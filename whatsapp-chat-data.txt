28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Guys today's q.
28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): All the elements of the input array will be consisting of '0' s and '1' s.
You have to output a single line 
With all the 1's and then remaining 0's of the input array.

Input format :
Take n,After that next line contains, n spaced integers i.e a1,a2...an  denoting the elements of the array.

Output format :
Print a single line consisting of length n.

Sample input:
6
0 1 0 1 0 1

Sample output:
1 1 1 0 0 0

Explaination :
As we can see there are 3 ones and 3 zeros in the input array,So output is accordingly.
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Just a note
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Haan will try

28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
 Plz
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): It has something to do with how second condition of B is placed.
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - +91 99201 75875: Assuming you're not supposed to used in built sort functions right?
28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Because if you reverse it. Write k first and then i
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): You get a totally different output
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): How???
28/01/2020, 7:39 pm - Tushar Nankani: Can you send the complete code? What is in the second printf?

28/01/2020, 7:43 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): <Media omitted>

28/01/2020, 7:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): In-built
28/01/2020, 7:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Because it enters the loop because of k. And i gets printed too.
28/01/2020, 7:49 pm - Tushar Nankani: The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10
28/01/2020, 7:50 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): So conclusion is
If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition.
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes. It's like any one of these conditions should be true. It's like using "OR". And not "AND".
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But depends na

Conditions ke middle me and hai ya or

28/01/2020, 7:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Guys 
One more thing 

We've gotta manage our academics also along with coding 

I know pointers don't matter much

But getting a decent pointer is important.....

If you all can 
You'll should allocate specific time for coding....

And plan day accordingly

Do 
num==sqr%pow(10,digits);

29/01/2020, 10:16 pm - +91 96536 93868: Since pow function gives float value ...10 ^2 can be stored as 99.999 or 100.0001 . When u write int it takes 99 in some compilers while 100 in some others
29/01/2020, 10:24 pm - +91 89764 07509: bro ek question hai
29/01/2020, 10:24 pm - +91 89764 07509: tune math.h library ko import nai kia na?
29/01/2020, 10:28 pm - +91 89764 07509: infact mere hisaab se undeclared indentifier ka error bhi pop up hona chaiye tha but run horaha hai🤯🤯
29/01/2020, 10:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24.
To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.

29/01/2020, 10:56 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): for 24.9999999 when you typecast it into int then it will be roundoff to 24 but if you add 0.5 you will be safe even if it's 25.000000001

29/01/2020, 11:29 pm - +91 99201 75875: It's a replacement for return 0
Return 0 terminates the program
cin.get() waits for the user to press a key (like Enter) before terminating the program

29/01/2020, 11:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It should give 24.999999
29/01/2020, 11:36 pm - +91 99201 75875: getch is not part of the std library and is more turbo c++ specific tbh
Not really sure but there is a difference between getch and cin.get()

29/01/2020, 11:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): darshan sir told us to avoid statements like break if possible since it causes halt in the flow of the program abruptly and causes voltage fluctuations  (just telling this to you),so just keep that in mind
29/01/2020, 11:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Otherwise logic is excellent
29/01/2020, 11:44 pm - +91 99201 75875: Break is a really really common statement and is present in all programs
Sir might've said cause turbo C might not be able to handle it

29/01/2020, 11:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It was some other editor
29/01/2020, 11:46 pm - Tushar Nankani: It was a normal text editor. And we used terminal for execution.
29/01/2020, 11:46 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
29/01/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 99201 75875: Let's say this is true then you could use the same logic and instead of writing it in main(),  make a separate function which just returned a Boolean and in the if statement replace break with return false and return true if the entire loop executes 
And in main just call the function with the user input int

else in the room. Given the fact that any two persons shake hand exactly once, Can you tell the total
count of handshakes?
Input Format
The first line contains the number of test cases T, T lines follow.
Each line then contains an integer N, the total number of Board of Directors of Acme.
Output Format
Print the number of handshakes for each test-case in a new line.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
0 < N < 10
Sample Input
2
1
2
Sample Output
0
1
Explanation
Case 1 : The lonely board member shakes no hands, hence 0.
Case 2 : There are 2 board members, 1 handshake takes place.

08/02/2020, 10:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And - 2^(no of bits-1) to 2^(no bits-1) -1 for signed
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 89764 07509: for int byte size req is 2 so since 1 byte =8 bits hence 2bytes=16 bits
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 89764 07509: therefore  2^(16)/2=32768
08/02/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 89764 07509: bro its 2^no of bits only

09/02/2020, 3:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Today's Challenge:

In C/C++ even after using the 'long long int' data type, we can compute factorial upto 20. 

Today's challenge is to write a program in C/C++ to calculate fatorial of a number 'N'

where 0 <= N <= 100

0! = 1
1! = 1
50! = 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000

12/02/2020, 8:40 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): My tips:
1)First get firm with language.
2)Do some good implementation q's.
3)In case your code gets *tle* just try to optimize by removing unnecessary nested for loops.

It is an easier one. Then to that one
14/02/2020, 7:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Today's Challenge:

You are given a *sorted* array NUM of *integers* as input.

You have to generate a *sorted* array SQ of the *squares* of the *integers* of the given array.

Constraints:

1 <= length(NUM) <= 10000
-10000 <= element of NUM <= 10000

This can be done in linear time complexity.
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Please try to do this without nested for loops
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Means ? What shud be the output?
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): An array of squares of the numbers
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): in the given array
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): this is out put

14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Understood bud
14/02/2020, 7:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): NUM = { -2 , -1 , 0, 3, 5}
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Output:

SQ = { 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 25 }
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Ok so first we have to find the squares
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Put it in another array
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Then sort it
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ya
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - +91 95949 08570: Correct?

14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): but that is very very inefficient
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): can be done using  better logic
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): only 1 for loop
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Kinda ascending? Descending?
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): see example

14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - +91 96536 93868: for sorting we need nested loop but the question can be solved without it .....
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): exactly
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919594908570 
I had implemented a similar program in Java with Strings.
I have tested it with numbers upto 1000.

14/02/2020, 7:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You can do without sorting
14/02/2020, 7:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Because sort function in C++ has O(nlogn) merge  sort is used......
14/02/2020, 7:53 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We want linear complexity
14/02/2020, 7:53 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): O(n)

14/02/2020, 8:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What if a number is repeated?

Fix:

    cin>>n;
    int a[n],c[10000]={0};

15/02/2020, 6:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is always good to implement error checking.
But the problem is that using `goto` is not recommended.

19/02/2020, 10:21 pm - +91 70394 60876: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109

20/02/2020, 1:03 am - +91 70394 60876: Okay so,
From the array if you remove one element, the sum of the rest of the elements become divisible by 7.
In case of multiple such elements find the smallest one

21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Tushar Nankani: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109
21/02/2020, 12:42 am - Tushar Nankani: Take a string as an input from the user.
Make a new string of length 18 characters, containing random characters and the new string should also contain each and every letter of the input string(also distributed randomly).
Example
Input:
Controller
Output:

22/02/2020, 10:05 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower you Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.

22/02/2020, 11:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Also, 
Many of us are  used to coding in an IDE or Text editor 
the environment of Hackerrank/Codechef/Codeforces is very different 
So a little into to that will be great
Like, most of the times, our solution is correct but because we did not print output in the way they wanted, it shows an error
22/02/2020, 11:04 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yes that'll be covered , dw
22/02/2020, 11:17 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): i find coding in text editor easier than hackerrank or other site Ide...u just upload the local file while submitting
22/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ya, but you gotta see how they take input and out put na
Consider testcases
make for loops and all
22/02/2020, 11:19 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): so that can be done in text editors too right..?
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): yes
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But the problem is I can't analyse how they want input some times

01/03/2020, 10:57 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Instructions for the mashup:
You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): when you use void main program keeps on running?
01/03/2020, 11:05 am - +91 79770 56210: It runs in the ide but when i submit it it gives runtime error
01/03/2020, 11:08 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): i guess CodeForces's compiler expects a return value 0 to be returned from every program. If 0 is returned, it means program has been executed successfully. If anything other than that means something is wrong with the code.
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 79770 56210: Ohk
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 99693 94098: void main never worked with C89 or C99 anyway

03/03/2020, 10:26 pm - Tushar Nankani: Anyone else who got the third one?
03/03/2020, 10:30 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): If a[i] % m = a[j] % m for some i < j, then answer is 0. Otherwise there are <= m numbers, so you can calculate answer in O(N^2).

05/03/2020, 12:56 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For java:
```import java.io.*;
...

BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

Integer.parseInt(in.readLine()); //for integer
in.readLine() //for String```
05/03/2020, 12:57 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Btw if they are faster why they r not default in languages?😶
05/03/2020, 12:58 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): N why do we have slower versions

05/03/2020, 2:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because they have several disadvantages as well.
For example, in C++,
```cin.tie(NULL)``` means that you can input data while the program is printing to the screen.
```ios::sync_with_stdio(false)``` does not sync ```cout``` with ```printf```.

08/03/2020, 1:59 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

15/03/2020, 11:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Example 2: This shows the creation and import of user-defined file.

Creating a user-defined header by the name of “process.h”.
// It is not recommended to put function definitions 
// in a header file. Ideally there should be only 
// function declarations. Purpose of this code is 
// to only demonstrate working of header files. 

  

void add(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Added value=%d\n", a + b); 
} 

  

void multiply(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Multiplied value=%d\n", a * b); 
} 
Created the main file where the above “process.h” will be included.
// C program to illustrate file inclusion 
// <> used to import system header file 
#include <stdio.h> 

  
// " " used to import user-defined file 
#include "process.h" 

  
// main function 

int main() 
{ 

    // add function defined in process.h 

    add(10, 20); 

  

    // mult function defined in process.h 

    mult(10, 20); 

  

    // printf defined in stdio.h 

    printf("Process completed"); 

    return 0;

15/03/2020, 7:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!
Here is the link for today's contest  (7.30 pm to 9.30 pm):

1. hackerRank
2. HackerEarth
3. Codechef
4. Codeforces

Please start practicing on hackerRank and HackerEarth first
Get comfortable with it and then on codechef and codeforces

Otherwise problems on codechef and codeforces are enough to make u feel demotivated .
Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually.
17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ok everyone so let's start
Road to CP
1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not.
Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something.
Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.
If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it.
Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible
2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP.
3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend)
Check out this video

https://youtu.be/4VD5wpLq1EQ

This video is by karan Gujar from Thakur college of Engineering

I know him personally.
We were preparing for IIT together in RIIT classes
Now he is a 6th star coder on codechef 
Follow each and every point he told in the video.

Also follow him on quora for various answers and medium for his blog posts and tutorials.

This is one of the most common questions about which students remain confused 
"How to manage projects development and CP?"
Check out Rachit jain answer
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: One Important thing u have to insure that will doing CP ur growth and problem solving should increase exponentially.
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Please make sure u watch this video only after u have started with C++ and covered a large topics on it 
Otherwise trees linked list all this things might become confusing for u.

But if ur in Second year ofcourse DSA has been covered in college so u should try to get comfortable with c++ within 2-3 weeks if u dont know c++ and then u can follow that with DSA
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: For FE students:
In college C language is covered by now,right? So learning c++ will be very easy BUT before properly learning c++ fundementals such as loops,arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic memory allocation etc and practicing questions on these topics 
Don't dare to jump on DSA.
For Second year:
Ur now stepping in third after a few months so u should better take a placement course because if u delay now things will become overwhelming because u have to Also focus on projects and when it comes to placement along with problem solving skills they will check ur knowledge of Object oriented programming, Database management, Operating System, computer networks. Many people will tell u that u don't need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it's better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews.
What u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don't expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem.

Companies do see ur Website profile specially hackerRank while if u Solve practice contest questions on codechef ur rating is not gonna increase as far as I know ratings codechef increases only when we participate and solve in long challenge, lunchtime and cookoff.
Rest as u wish practicing is important anyway

18/03/2020, 2:46 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Object creation is implicit call to a non-parameterized  constructor right?
18/03/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which language?
18/03/2020, 3:00 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Java
18/03/2020, 3:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When you create an object in Java, you always call a constructor.
```Object obj = new Object()```
18/03/2020, 3:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is an *explicit* call.
18/03/2020, 3:02 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In C++, you can have:
```Object obj``
18/03/2020, 3:02 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk

18/03/2020, 11:27 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This is an implicit call for the constructor.
You never explicitly call the constructor.
When you create a new obj of a class, you invoke the constructor of that class implicitly.
18/03/2020, 11:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Okay you can call another constructor explicitly from a constructor, but not otherwise.

18/03/2020, 12:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
18/03/2020, 12:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, yes, this is instantiation of an object, but how is this an implicit call?

You, the programmer, is explicitly writing ```new Object()```.

If this is an implicit call, then can you please give an example of an explicit call.
18/03/2020, 12:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Did you read the article?

I think that it is about constructor overloading using ```this```.
18/03/2020, 7:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/0CDKwzf0JxM
18/03/2020, 7:09 pm - +91 97739 65140: Ok so this is how I have learnt it.
In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class
Hence, implicit call
*But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation.
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: The second case will be explicit creation
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: *call
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You are mixing the default (implicit) constructor *definition* with implicit *calling*.
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When you define a class and do not provide a constructor, Java implicitly defines the default constructor.

But when you declare an object as ```Object obj```, *no constructor is called* and ```obj = null```.
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is unlike C++, where the non parameterized constructor is called implicitly.

21/03/2020, 1:18 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.
Good luck!

23/03/2020, 10:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Steve has a string of lowercase characters in range ascii[‘a’..’z’]. He wants to reduce the string to its shortest length by doing a series of operations. In each operation he selects a pair of adjacent lowercase letters that match, and he deletes them. For instance, the string aab could be shortened to b in one operation.

Steve’s task is to delete as many characters as possible using this method and print the resulting string. If the final string is empty, print Empty String

Function Description

Complete the superReducedString function in the editor below. It should return the super reduced string or Empty String if the final string is empty.

superReducedString has the following parameter(s):

s: a string to reduce
Input Format

A single string, .

Constraints

Output Format

If the final string is empty, print Empty String; otherwise, print the final non-reducible string.

Sample Input 0

aaabccddd
Sample Output 0

abd
Explanation 0

Steve performs the following sequence of operations to get the final string:

aaabccddd → abccddd → abddd → abd
Sample Input 1

aa

25/03/2020, 12:15 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): *ATTENTION*
Internet services have become slow & there can be a complete breakdown, so lets not fwd VIDEOS ...

There is limited bandwidth only. It’s being heavily guzzled by OTTs steaming videos- Amazon/ hot star / Netflix. 

Critical services  need to be prioritised.

 Internet providers are having a tough time keeping the telco facilities on with all sorts of lock down and mass apathy and no staff. 

So please only use and watch what’s necessary and switch to non HD streaming

 🙏. And don’t forward non essential videos.

Else full shut down is not far. If they shut down
Pls be careful

26/03/2020, 12:06 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): In today's world, basic programming skills are extremely advantageous in a tech driven world. You can use it to customise games, build your own websites and do things that you can't already do with your computer. As a computer engineering student I have done this before for first year engineering students and 8th grade students. During this time of curfew, I feel I should introduce even more people to this amazing skill.

The workshop shall be conducted online, as either a call or youtube live.

The workshop shall be completely free of charge. 

Kindly register here if interested, and we'll decide on a time and date suitable for all

30/03/2020, 8:58 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Ig upper_bound will make it much simpler
30/03/2020, 9:11 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No, upper bound returns an iterator to the value just greater than X. 

Lower bound returns an iterator to the value NOT LESS THAN 'X'. Means lower bound will return an iterator to the value if value is present the array . While upper bound will return an iterator to the element which is strictly greater than the value. If value is not present in the array it will return an iterator pointing to position just after vector_name.end().While lower bound will return an iterator pointing to the value.
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 88305 26885: Then in this we might have to implement binary search
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Lower bound internally binary search hi hai

31/03/2020, 12:06 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): I embarked on my journey of learning and discovering  ML in the first year of Engineering, ever since each day is about figuring out fascinating developments in ML 📊
However this journey would not be easy if it weren't for the support of my seniors,mentors and the exposures I got being a part of committees in college.
Few days ago when people approached me for organizing an *ML workshop*, I thought there was no better way to reciprocate the support and push I had received myself when I started some years back.
So I will be organising a workshop on ML:

*Where:* Online

*Time:* next week, time suitable to all

*Cost*: 🆓

Lets make the most of the time, that we have in abundance due to lockdown, to discover and gain a basic idea as to what ML is!
*Those interested please fill out the form:*  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRAs17JL2S7Ynm5LdHXLEmkzZ2mIONcXPgGSaKdwKJNDXjBA/viewform?usp=sf_link

31/03/2020, 3:36 pm - Tushar Nankani: This ML Workshop would be directed in a way to introduce all interested to the world of ML (it is kinda impossible to teach everything in a workshop, but its a good idea to get started on it.)
31/03/2020, 3:37 pm - Tushar Nankani: The workshop would consist of the following topics:
Numpy and Pandas
Data Preprocessing(using Numpy and Pandas)
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
31/03/2020, 3:39 pm - Tushar Nankani: The above three are branches of ML. A proper introduction would be given, along with one or two models in it for understanding. Though there will be a prerequisite of python, but he'll be going through the basics at the start.
He will try to explain a few projects, share the code for us to understand.

03/04/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 88305 26885: Iterate over the array and check whether we have a permutation upto this index
03/04/2020, 10:06 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): ohhh okay
03/04/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 88305 26885: U had any other thoughts?
03/04/2020, 10:08 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): i was thinking about iterative only between pos of 1s
03/04/2020, 10:09 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): didnt consider the fact that 0 answer was possible too
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 88305 26885: What was ur approach for checking permutation?
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): what was ur tc?
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): used set
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 88305 26885: Oh and then check is size equal to max element and all
03/04/2020, 10:11 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): hmm wouldnt work for l2 though
03/04/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 88305 26885: My code took 342ms others had 42ms also
03/04/2020, 10:13 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): ohhh
03/04/2020, 10:13 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): how did u check permutation?
03/04/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 88305 26885: Inserted in the set maintained two variables for min and Max and then checked whether size is equal to max or not and  min =1
03/04/2020, 10:15 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): nice i had thought about it but didnt think that would've been efficient xP

04/04/2020, 9:58 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Can anyone explain the difference between the following in java?
ArrayList<String> fruits=new ArrayList ();
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList();
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Also can any1 explain the meaning of the second statement in this?

04/04/2020, 10:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Technically, both your statements are wrong:
```ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();```

04/04/2020, 10:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In 1st statement, variable ```fruits``` is an ArrayList, and in second statement, it is of type List.
List is an abstract class, so it cannot be instantiated directly.
List is used to group several different implementations of Lists, like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.
04/04/2020, 10:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Both statements have almost identical functionality, the only difference is that if you want to change the implementation for any reason, you will have to update all the code.
The second statement allows you to hide the actual list implementation.
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ty
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It gives a warning
05/04/2020, 12:14 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): List is an interface iy
05/04/2020, 12:14 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ig
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No: ```error: List is abstract; cannot be instantiated```.
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean both are not type safe.
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
05/04/2020, 12:18 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Gives issues
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Collection is an interface and List extends Collection and itself is an interface as well
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Then ArrayList,LinkedList etc are classes in List
05/04/2020, 12:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You learn something every day.
05/04/2020, 12:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```public interface List<E> extends Collection<E>```
05/04/2020, 12:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (From the source code)
05/04/2020, 12:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But did you understand the difference?
05/04/2020, 12:27 am - Tushar Nankani: 🙌🏻
05/04/2020, 12:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I am learning Java from Apni kaksha(Aman Dhattarwal's channel)
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 🤔 why is there a generic at the end
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because Collection is also generic.
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk

05/04/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 97681 67131: Given a string of digits S, insert a minimum number of opening and closing parentheses into it such that the resulting string is balanced and each digit d is inside exactly d pairs of matching parentheses.
Let the nesting of two parentheses within a string be the substring that occurs strictly between them. An opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis that is further to its right are said to match if their nesting is empty, or if every parenthesis in their nesting matches with another parenthesis in their nesting. The nesting depth of a position p is the number of pairs of matching parentheses m such that p is included in the nesting of m.
For example, in the following strings, all digits match their nesting depth: 0((2)1), (((3))1(2)), ((((4)))), ((2))((2))(1). The first three strings have minimum length among those that have the same digits in the same order, but the last one does not since ((22)1) also has the digits 221 and is shorter.
Given a string of digits S, find another string S', comprised of parentheses and digits, such that:
all parentheses in S' match some other parenthesis,
removing any and all parentheses from S' results in S,
each digit in S' is equal to its nesting depth, and
S' is of minimum length.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line represents a test case and contains only the string S.
Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the string S' defined above.
Limits
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
1 ≤ length of S ≤ 100.
Test set 1 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is either 0 or 1.
Test set 2 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is a decimal digit between 0 and 9, inclusive.
Sample

Input   
 
4
0000
101
111000
1

Output 
Case #1: 0000
Case #2: (1)0(1)
Case #3: (111)000
Case #4: (1)

  
The strings ()0000(), (1)0(((()))1) and (1)(11)000 are not valid solutions to Sample Cases #1, #2 and #3, respectively, only because they are not of minimum length. In addition, 1)( and )(1 are not valid solutions to Sample Case #4 because they contain unmatched parentheses and the nesting depth is 0 at the position where there is a 1.
You can create sample inputs that are valid only for Test Set 2 by removing the parentheses from the example strings mentioned in the problem statement.

05/04/2020, 5:19 pm - +91 82916 21138: Use stack
05/04/2020, 5:20 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): No need to use that too
Just a counter and an empty string's enough
05/04/2020, 5:21 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): U solved it using stack?
05/04/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 97681 67131: In python converting it to str to list and since lists are like vectors i manuplate it and then at last convert it to str back
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Is what I thought
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: I did not give today's mashup but I saw similar kind of stuff
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Oh okay
05/04/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: But without it it can be done
05/04/2020, 5:23 pm - +91 82916 21138: Its good problem but I saw something similar but was bit more high level so they used stack  I got confused and thought it's same problem 🤦🏻‍♂😅
05/04/2020, 5:24 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Could be solved by just traversing string..
05/04/2020, 5:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Oh u mean slicing
05/04/2020, 5:26 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya thought of it but how would nesting of brackets work is where I got confused let me try that way
05/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 82916 21138: Stack will do the work 🤔
05/04/2020, 6:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I solved using array.

```import java.util.*;
import java.math.*;

//public class Solution{
public class A{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		char[] a;
		StringBuffer o;
		for(int t = 0, cases = sc.nextInt(); t < cases; t++){
			a = sc.next().toCharArray();
			
			o = new StringBuffer();
			repeat('(', a[0] - '0', o);
			o.append(a[0]);
			for(int i = 1, d; i < a.length; i++){
				d = a[i] - a[i - 1];
				if(d < 0)
					repeat(')', -d, o);
				else if(d > 0)
					repeat('(', d, o);
				
				o.append(a[i]);
			}
			repeat(')', a[a.length - 1] - '0', o);
			
			System.out.println("Case #" + (t + 1) + ": " + o);
		}
		
		sc.close();
	}
	
	private static void repeat(char c, int n, StringBuffer sb){
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			sb.append(c);
	}
}```
05/04/2020, 6:32 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes slicing joining i.e string manipulation I could make it work
05/04/2020, 6:33 pm - +91 97681 67131: This will work thanks
05/04/2020, 7:35 pm - +91 97681 67131: T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    S = str(input())
    y = ''.join([int(strelement) * '(' + strelement + ')' * int(strelement) for strelement in S])
    for j in range(9):
        y = y.replace(')(', '')
    print("Case #{}: {}".format(i+1, y))
05/04/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 97681 67131: Searching Number In String Then Based on its value adding numbersValue * that many brackets and replacing )( brackets caused due to numbers of same order

07/04/2020, 1:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): can any1 explain why are using (String) in the above code?
07/04/2020, 1:58 am - +91 77150 51136: (String) is not required😅
07/04/2020, 1:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah figured it out
07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But when is it required then
07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean its a non-primitive data type right?
07/04/2020, 2:11 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (String) al.get(0); is explicit typecasting.
It is only required when your code is not typesafe.

If you make a generic (Object) ArrayList as: ```List al = new ArrayList();```, then you will need to typecast the objects while using get.
07/04/2020, 2:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is the reason why it is always encouraged to have a datatype in the ArrayList.
07/04/2020, 2:15 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Side note: If you have a generic ArrayList, then code like this will work.
```List al = new ArrayList();
al.add("Abcd");
al.add(10);
al.add(true);```
07/04/2020, 2:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah ty👍

11/04/2020, 8:09 pm - Tushar Nankani: Even the lighter versions are not opening^
11/04/2020, 8:10 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Due to a power outage Codeforces and Polygon are unavailable now.
11/04/2020, 8:11 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): 10 hrs hone aaye abhi tl kal k contets ka system testing he chal rha h😂

11/04/2020, 8:27 pm - +91 97681 67131: It is a iterator in python used to return values of a specific data type in a list, tuple, string or dictionaries
11/04/2020, 8:32 pm - Tushar Nankani: Map function is used to execute a function (defined) or also with the lambda expression and the values to be executed are also passed through.
11/04/2020, 8:32 pm - Tushar Nankani: ```map(func, *iterables)```
11/04/2020, 8:33 pm - +91 97027 35002: Got it
11/04/2020, 8:38 pm - +91 97681 67131: Can someone help me with a example and explaination of the usage of abstract classes and interfaces in Java
11/04/2020, 8:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): @917506412914 @918080142783
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If you work in an organisation and you need to follow a certain structure, an interface can be used to have uniformity of structure, but difference of implementations.

Interfaces help to maintain uniformity and consistency.
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 73043 57388: Interfaces are used when objects have common properties

For example
Students common properties are
Nane roll no DOB
Etc 
So student class can be parent class
And student can be of engineering , medical, pharmacy etc
So these branches becomes child classes
11/04/2020, 8:48 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Abstract classes can be used when you want to enforce only certain functions in that class and leave a choice for the other functions to be used or not.

The function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class. Their implementation cannot be changed or defined in the class extending the abstract class like the abstract fns
11/04/2020, 8:52 pm - +91 73043 57388: Oh sorry this is Inheritance explanation 🤦
11/04/2020, 8:53 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah
11/04/2020, 9:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread.
Interfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.

Classes provide MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE functionality. Like, if you have a ```Stack`` class and a ```Queue``` class. There is no point in creating a ``StackQueue``` class.
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah makes sense
Thank you
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - +91 97681 67131: So a superclass can inherit multiple such interfaces whereas it can only inherit one abstract class right?
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The PARENT class is called superclass.
Child classes are called subclasses.

In Java, one (sub)class can only inherit from one superclass, and multiple interfaces.

Note: C++ allows multiple inheritance.
11/04/2020, 9:08 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): A child class*
11/04/2020, 9:08 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE) added +91 70450 40641 and +91 98333 66146

12/04/2020, 5:28 pm - +91 88305 26885: i knew but specifically it was about connected components as saurav said
12/04/2020, 5:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Is String args[] compulsory?
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 82916 21138: Depends on ide but most of them it is
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I didn't include it any of my codes😅
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 88305 26885: @918408867834 it was a directed graph right is the algorithm same for both graphs ?
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Nope
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bluej mai it isn't

12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Codeforces mai it is ig,thats why run time error aa rha hai
12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - +91 82916 21138: I used doubly ended queue
12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): After finding SCC we get condensed graph and now in this condensed graph we can count nodes with indeg 0
12/04/2020, 5:32 pm - +91 88305 26885: Ig that's over my head😅
12/04/2020, 5:32 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/strongly-connected-components.html

for char in string.ascii_lowercase:

12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: are while loops slower than for loops?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: or is slicing the problem?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: if anyone knows pls tell
12/04/2020, 6:47 pm - Tushar Nankani: I think nested loops increases time a lot more in python. Initially, I used while and for; which gave me TLE.
12/04/2020, 6:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Therefore, alternative would be by taking that counter ```k```, avoiding the while loop.
12/04/2020, 6:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: I don't think so^
12/04/2020, 6:49 pm - Tushar Nankani: I am not sure about this though.

12/04/2020, 6:56 pm - +91 97681 67131: ya i also read that too but i think strings faster when we use them for concatination i think working with lists also helped his soln
12/04/2020, 7:17 pm - +91 77150 51136: Maybe you can use replace
12/04/2020, 7:43 pm - +91 97681 67131: replace will remove all occurences of given character from string so i think will not work
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: It also has count parameter
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: You can use that
12/04/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 97681 67131: ya wait let me try if it accepts that
12/04/2020, 7:49 pm - +91 77150 51136: 👍🏻
12/04/2020, 8:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: There are three things increasing time complexity i think upon trying to run various versions in time it :
12/04/2020, 8:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: 1) s.count(char) != 0: instead just in operator works for checking
2) using lists therefore inturn using ranges for them as @919820487592 said they are more efficient and also thus while loop causing more time

15/04/2020, 12:43 pm - +91 73043 57388: Hello everyone there is one important thing which I learned just now that one of the person whom I reffered to follow on Quora for CP has caught for cheating in codeJam Round 1A and that is Karan Gujar 
Because I didn't knew about previous allegations on him and even now it's not 100% sure whether or not he has done it( but it seems most probably that he really cheated that's because he has deleted all his social media handles) so I suggested him.
It's very unfortunate thing that has happened and I my advice my fellow programming aspirants don't rush behind ratings, stars red coder etc focus on becoming a good programmer each day and try to learn new things all this ratings stars etc will come with time but u should not be ready to compromise ur ethics and values just for the sake of Show off and publicity because its not going to help in the long run.

18/04/2020, 9:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): How do we exactly solve problems involving subsets?like what should be our approach?
18/04/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 73043 57388: Recursion
18/04/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 73043 57388: ?
18/04/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 73043 57388: Give me a problem
18/04/2020, 10:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Like this one
18/04/2020, 10:19 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Its a Div 2 A problem
18/04/2020, 10:19 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No need of recursion
18/04/2020, 10:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): If there is an even element in array there is an answer consisting of only it. Otherwise if there is at least two odd elements in array there is an answer consisting of this two elements. Otherwise array is only one odd element and there is no answer.

18/04/2020, 10:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Thanks 👊🏻
18/04/2020, 11:12 pm - +91 73043 57388: The problems on finding subsets are usually called combination of numbers problem 
For finding subsets u simply combine the concept of iteration and recursion 

For that u have to create 2 arrays one will be having all given numbers
Second array will be temporary array which is going to hold every possible subset by taking each number of the given array one by one

So suppose u have 
Given array 1 2 3 4
And u wan to find all possible subsets

We use a for loop for traversing through the given loop

For(i=0;i<n;i++)
{ 
   temp[0]=arr[i];
   Recursion_func
}

We draw a recursion tree for that
18/04/2020, 11:13 pm - +91 73043 57388: Explaination of recursion function I will give u tomorrow if u don't mind

25/04/2020, 12:10 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Difficult choice between Python and Kotlin.
25/04/2020, 12:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why tho?
25/04/2020, 12:25 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Python gone means a lot of stuff from this field gone and Kotlin gone means bye-bye android applications
25/04/2020, 12:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, just the LANGUAGE, not the all the programs. I just don't like Python's syntax.
98% of android apps are written in Java even today. Kotlin was supposed to reduce the boilerplate needed for Java.
But, in Kotlin, you have to type ```val a: int;```. In Java, it is ```int a;``` now which one is shorter?
25/04/2020, 12:49 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Kotlin is now official Android language ig
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, unfortunately. But most of the Android api's are still in Java, and even today, you cannot make an Android app without using at least some Java.
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But both languages are JVM compatible, so I will stick to Java, at least for now.
25/04/2020, 1:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍
25/04/2020, 1:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah

25/04/2020, 5:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂
25/04/2020, 5:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But I will really choose R  or Java.

30/04/2020, 5:32 pm - +91 99693 94098: Hey everyone,
I would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy.
After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus
Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.

30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: Easier insertions and deletions of elements
30/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 98331 51331: Also sorting
30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk ty
30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Why are you implementing Deque
30/04/2020, 8:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): to solve some qs?
30/04/2020, 8:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): no just learning it from some article
30/04/2020, 8:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): i mean in java,you can create a deque object either with ArrayList or LinkedList
30/04/2020, 9:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, sorting is horrible in LinkedList.
30/04/2020, 9:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
30/04/2020, 9:17 pm - +91 98331 51331: Oh my bad
30/04/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 73043 57388: But if u practice sorting using linkedlist ur pointer concepts in c/c++ will be sharped and u will become fast with pointers.
30/04/2020, 11:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I meant performance wise.

02/05/2020, 4:50 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Good work!

My suggestions:
- Tell the user that a left swipe on a note will delete it (add a small line of text at the head)
- On the profile page at the bottom, add your name in the fol. format: 'Made with ❤️ by Gaurav Raj' (with Gaurav Raj being a hyperlink to your social media. Your project is open source, so add a link to your repo for contributions...)
- Further features: 
-- Notifications / reminders (take both time & date)
-- Add a choice to input some description as well.

Just my opinions and suggestions, you're free to do as you want to!

Awesome work on the app. Keep building and preferably keep building up on one or two project(s) rather than making too many projects.

Keep going!

I am not really good at Development but
 --> Some small suggestions from my side.
- When we re-edit the note, try changing the date and time, as "last edited". 
- When we tap on the picture to change the profile, it opens up the camera directly. Maybe try adding another option, asking access for the gallery, so as to select the image from the gallery. 

Looks amazing! Keep it up! ^_^

03/05/2020, 7:59 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Codeforces Round #639: the round is rescheduled.

Hello, Codeforces!

Unfortunately, I report that I decided to reschedule this round. I'm afraid that something might go wrong. Some strange database behavior has appeared, which leads to slow operation in completely unexpected places (it never was and should not be). I will work hard to fix it. My recent tests show that this can dramatically increase judging time (and leads to a huge queue). I don't want to risk the efforts of the writer, the coordinator, testers, and your time. Sorry about it, I was trying to fix it for many hours but I need more time. Hope it will be a great round!

Mike.

UPD: I temporarily rescheduled it on May, 6. But I'll discuss the date with the writer and coordinator and reschedule it again to the date they want.

03/05/2020, 9:16 pm - Tushar Nankani: *Sort 10 billion numbers*

10 billion numbers are given, sort them


*Approach 1 :-  (External Sorting)*
Here k is the size of maximum elements which  can be sorted internally.
Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose.
1) Divide the numbers in group of k.
2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort )
    Merge sort all the groups.
3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k.
4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group.
5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file.
6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged.
7) Update the min heap.
8) Go to step 5.



*Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*

1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ.
   The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements.
2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time.
   If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group.
   Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group.
3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ.
4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order.
5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.

_In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._
_where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._

05/05/2020, 1:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍
05/05/2020, 1:19 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): How 0?
05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Pehle it'll assign i as 0
05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Then it'll increment
05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Toh i stays 0 always
05/05/2020, 1:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): i=i++
05/05/2020, 1:21 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Iske baad I ki value badegi nhi kya?
05/05/2020, 1:22 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Badhega but that'll be useless
05/05/2020, 1:23 pm - Tushar Nankani: You're basically assigning i = 0. And then incrementing the value to 1. But i is already assigned as 0. This process keeps getting repeated.
05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ✅✅
05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Yeah.. got it..thnx yeah..
05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Tushar Nankani: It's due to the post increment. If it was pre-increment: i = ++i, then it will increment to 1, then assign it to i. So in this case i remains 1.
05/05/2020, 1:25 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Oh ..got it
05/05/2020, 1:26 pm - +91 88305 26885: It's actually undefined

05/05/2020, 1:43 pm - +91 88305 26885: But it's more compiler based rather than a well defined error
05/05/2020, 1:44 pm - +91 97027 35002: It should get incremented after assigning value right?

People who have been wanting/thinking to start off with competitive programming, I personally think this will be a good start.

As Codeforces has come up with the first ever Division 4 contest which will be held this Saturday 8th May.

You all can register right now:
https://codeforces.com/contests/1352

And you can read more about it here:
https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77028
08/05/2020, 1:01 am - Tushar Nankani: 9th May* Saturday.
08/05/2020, 1:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 1) All pending semester exams (except final semester) are effectively cancelled in Maharashtra.
2) Marks will be given according to UGC guidelines i.e. 50% marks based on this SEM internal assessment and 50% based on last semester exam performance.
3) If you are unhappy with this Sem marks, University will announce dates for Re-Exam which will probably be a 80 mark paper (not clarified as to of how many marks the re exam will be)
4) All those who fail in this Sem internal assessment will have to give exams in next sem or the Re-Exam as notified by the University.
5) All those already having ATKT in previous Sems will have to give exams for them within 120 days of college reopening, the timetable for which will be announced by respective university.

Could you please add an apk (assuming the project is an android one - I have no app dev exp) as a release and provide it to us so that we can have a look at your app? Also, there is no README in your project. Do add one!

Any idea.
10/05/2020, 9:51 pm - Mohammed (TSEC, EXTC): You need to learn java or kotlin first

11/05/2020, 5:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Guys lmk your opinion on this:
Should I do both android dev and Problem Solving together?
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): See my problem solving is again lagging since I am doing android dev recently
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And if I start problem solving again then... android bhul jata hai
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): The thing is that....I want to improve my problem solving day by day as well as keep adding projects to GitHub.... please do help me out here....
11/05/2020, 5:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Chip your opinions in plz....will be greatly appreciated
11/05/2020, 5:15 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): yes

11/05/2020, 7:22 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Don't 'keep adding projects to GitHub'. Neither is that the aim, nor is having a lot of projects the aim. The aim is to keep building up on a few projects.
11/05/2020, 7:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk👍

11/05/2020, 8:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why is the exe 23 MB?
11/05/2020, 8:27 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): idk i converted a .py to .exe using pyinstaller,
now about the size u can ask them
11/05/2020, 8:27 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): rest assured its safe
11/05/2020, 8:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, I thought that this was a native program. If you converted a .py file then it bundles the python interpreter as well.
11/05/2020, 8:28 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): try it
11/05/2020, 8:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, I am downloading the file.
11/05/2020, 8:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But please just send the source files next time.
11/05/2020, 8:30 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): the problem with that
> you need python
>also you need pygame
>to install pygame you need pip
>and yeah... you get the point😂
11/05/2020, 8:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most people here have python installed.
Python comes with pip.
I also happen to have pygame installed.
The python source files will be << 1kb.
11/05/2020, 8:32 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): very true
11/05/2020, 8:32 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): but what about ppl who dont have it
11/05/2020, 8:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```pip install pygame```

11/05/2020, 8:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Is the Sudoku hardcoded?
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): for the exe yes
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): check the source files
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): ive even included the option of setting your own board
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, you should not immediately inform the user if the entered number is wrong.
11/05/2020, 8:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Look into generating a random board each time.
11/05/2020, 8:37 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): good idea

11/05/2020, 8:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I had written a Sudoku Solver in Java once.
11/05/2020, 8:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I can't find the source code.
11/05/2020, 8:39 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): why do you love java so much
11/05/2020, 8:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It was for my final project in 10th.

20/05/2020, 7:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For eg, I can setup a GitLab CI action to run only when I push to a certain branch, and then automatically build, package and deploy a site, with different production and development instances.
Try doing that with GitLab Actions. Trust me, I have tried.
20/05/2020, 8:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Is Git Hub Devops?🤔
20/05/2020, 8:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Learn about Git, GitHub and more on: https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/
20/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Git is a part of DevOps.
GutHub is just a platform.
GitHub has other DevOps features like CI/CD.

@918080142783 am I correct?
20/05/2020, 9:35 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This can be done with GitHub Actions.

Haven't experimented with CI/CD yet, so you might be right about the complicated nature of GitHub to that of GitLab. I have no idea...
20/05/2020, 9:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Almost.
GitHub has tried to integrate CI/CD into the workflow like GitLab.
20/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh👍
20/05/2020, 9:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Isn't merging CI?

28/05/2020, 2:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *Insulate* I had to read that like 3 times.
28/05/2020, 2:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I struggled with Javascript methods of Materialize CSS

They need a better docs....
This is FUCKING AWFUL
28/05/2020, 2:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂😂
28/05/2020, 2:27 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I already saw it on the other place, will be providing feedback there
28/05/2020, 2:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍
28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is why I always advice: *DON'T USE LIBRARIES*.
28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted

28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yuppp
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So plain CSS is the way to go?
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Vanilla* CSS
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In my opinion: Always.
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): CSS => Complete Suffering & Sadness
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohh....
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Definitely look to libraries for inspiration, and feel free to copy whatever you like.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Smart!
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I feel that the only time you should be using libraries is for prototypes, never for the final version of an app/website.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This way, you aren't really using the library, but you also are ......
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh
Alright
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ESPECIALLY CSS/JavaScript libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh ..
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So I should not use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS, etc for my projects...
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Unless the library ADDS critical functionality (eg: PDF parser, WebSocket management) you should think twice before using it.
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, the decision is up to you, but I don't like to use these libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): What is a CDN is used?
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If*
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We're having real talks at 2.35 AM
This is fucking awesome!!!!!
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): 👏👏
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A CDN can only speed up the download times.
28/05/2020, 2:36 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but it only imports the code that is called...

Now if you're saying that that code is a lot as compared to when done with vanilla CSS, then you have to be good at that...

My vanilla CSS with flexbox looks like this:
https://harshkapadia2.github.io/lbl-tribute-page/
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which seems like a MASSIVE waste.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It's so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You sure do have a point 
But what if, I say I'm not really concerned abt frontend 
I don't want to waste my time adjusting padding and all etc.....

I just want to show off my backend functionality.....
Then what should I do?
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called?
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh yeah 🤦🏻‍♂️
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): True true
28/05/2020, 2:41 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): However, there is something called "Tree Shaking" where unused portions of the library are removed.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you lose the benefit of a CDN.
28/05/2020, 2:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, what backend functionality?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Give me an example.
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Suppose, I'm building a rest api..
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Tbh I used a template for Attendance Manager v1
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It was just a backend project then...
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeahh
You told me once ...
Now I remember....
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end...
28/05/2020, 2:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): No idea what should be done...
28/05/2020, 2:49 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don't use flex box..
Why do you need??
28/05/2020, 2:50 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Bootstrap handles it all na?
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I try to avoid BootStrap alltogether.
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Try CSS Grid.
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohh that is absolute beauty  .....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I've used it ....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Its lengthy, 
But it works...
It works perfectly 
It works always....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Somebody put it nicely: "Grid is how CSS should have been designed in the first place".
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Now, that you say it.....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 🔥🔥
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Are you on Twitter M
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?*
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh okay.....
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Is v2 on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wanted to tag ya
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh, ok.
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, I am not sure that using a server is important.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The advantage of not using libraries/frameworks is that the website is MUCH lighter, and hence most of the logic can be offloaded to the client.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It will greatly reduce the load on the server.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Also,
It  gives us a better understanding of what actually is happening....
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You know, what you have coded and 
That's what you are seeing...
Not some pre written code, which you are using.....
28/05/2020, 3:03 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There's one thing I give you,
The satisfaction of building a complete thing, from scratch, on our own, line by line is 😍😍😍😍
28/05/2020, 3:07 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The satisfaction of finishing a project is much greater.
I would say that if you feel that the only way that you can finish a project is to use a library, then go for it.
But you should definitely try to do at least one project without a library.
28/05/2020, 3:08 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): True!
I'll complete this project, with a library,
But the next one is definitely gonna be VANILLA EVERYTHING
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you want to try vanilla, your mother's website is a great project.https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is better to have a long, scrolling page that has all the images instead of having 5 links that people have to click on.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is NEVER a good idea.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It makes it very difficult to view all the images.
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohhh
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I thought, it made things easier to view category wise.....
28/05/2020, 3:15 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you would have only suggested me before I started!
Anyways...
Next time!
28/05/2020, 3:16 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but if I want to view all the images, then I have to click on each link, then click 20 times on the >> button.
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yaa....
What I'll do is.....
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll create a grid of all images
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If someone wants to see an enlarged view, I'll add something like a pop-up feature 
When the user clicks on a particular image....
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even now is not too late.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is exactly what I had in mind.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like Google Images.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Cool!
My Gallery page is sorted now!
Thanks @918080142783
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Let me know if you need help.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Sure!!
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, a solid background color is quite boring.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's a gradient....
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What?
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah....
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Well, it looks like a solid color.
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wait
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Which one are you talking about?
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm talking about this one....
28/05/2020, 3:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Pick a gradient somewhere like https://uigradients.com/ .
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh, I thought you were talking about https://dheerajdlalwani.github.io/ImageGallery/
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah,
That was old version
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The new one looks good, but the transitions seem a little... too flashy.
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What about a simple, left to right translate?
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That was like the first thing that popped up in Materialize CSS docs😅
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll change it to that
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Is the new website on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Less is always more!
Minimalistic design....
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not hosted though
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll send the link
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know about http://htmlpreview.github.io/
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Noo!
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll check it out!
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, it's a Django project
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): WHY?
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's a shop!😅
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): E commerce
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So?
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll be adding payment gateways and all
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): E - commerce only makes sense if you will be getting at least 10 orders per day.
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): For practicing!!!
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😅😅
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Last time I checked, the seller registration was like 10,000 per month.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It might be better to take orders via phone or email.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hm....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm making this project to just explore....
And see how it feels ......
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Getting comfy with the tech...
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): My mom takes all orders via phone only.....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even then, building a payment gateway is not easy.
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I've to just integrate right?
They're like ready made I saw in some Tutorials.....
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you seriously want to learn about accepting online payments, then it might be better to look into a payment service like BillDesk or Shopify.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hm.....
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you only want to integrate with an existing provider then you might be able to use the REST api directly.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Without the need for a server.
28/05/2020, 3:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay...
This is more like PC

28/05/2020, 3:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK.

This guy has a *GREAT* point

Do reade the complete thread
01/06/2020, 11:59 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Damn, this is unique!

What are your thoughts @919689727471 and @918408867834?
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I would suggest spending at least 30 minutes on each problem.
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But otherwise, this is great advice.
02/06/2020, 12:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hmm.....
02/06/2020, 12:12 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): This can be done for interview questions as they are repetitive. But in Cp, questions aren't that repetitive. Every question has something new. That's why for cp, you have to think for an hour at least on every problem that's hard for you. People spend days solving a single question in CodeChef Long Challenge(8 questions 10 days to solve). Questions are hard. But you get learn 5-6 different concepts by solving a single question.
02/06/2020, 12:14 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This is if you're doing it for the love of CP, right? Would you recommend this for interviews as well?
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If you want to do hardcore cp then this might good for starting
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This is what i think
02/06/2020, 12:17 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): I haven't started with interview questions yet. But yeah you should think for an hour at least. That'll improve your problem solving skills. And in interviews, they won't ask you questions which are already there on gfg(for FAANG companies). They'll always slightly change the question. To solve the question during interview you should have excellent problem solving skills.
02/06/2020, 12:18 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): 👍👍
02/06/2020, 12:18 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): FAANG=Facebook, Amazon,Apple, Netflix, Google

05/06/2020, 3:47 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I saw this
05/06/2020, 3:47 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This is literally dangerous !!!
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yes its deep
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don't attempt to download the image
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): At any cost....
05/06/2020, 3:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Where can it be accessed but😅?
05/06/2020, 3:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Follow the video
05/06/2020, 3:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Do reverse Google image search
05/06/2020, 3:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, highly not  recommended
05/06/2020, 3:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you want to use your phone....
05/06/2020, 4:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, at the end of the video, he said that he could not replicate the bug with any other photo.
05/06/2020, 4:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I think that it should not be too difficult.
05/06/2020, 4:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So can someone please test this on an EMULATOR. I don't want to factory reset mine.
05/06/2020, 4:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://www.ubackground.com/wallpaper/nature/lake_mountain_sunset/17-0-19786
05/06/2020, 4:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂
05/06/2020, 4:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You're tempting me to download on my phone 🙄🙄
05/06/2020, 4:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Almost downloaded it😂
05/06/2020, 4:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Delete that link
05/06/2020, 4:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂😂
05/06/2020, 4:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Please do so
Before I download 😂
05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - +91 86559 19035: Usme bas ek pixel ka issue hai all the max values for RGB pixel are 255 and there's a formula to calculate the number for each R G B pixel and it actually comes around 254 and due to approximation of the formula to the nearest integer in Android it calculate the value as 256 and when you apply it you are screwed
It's prophoto RGB image so don't try it out
05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, I wanted to check if using a custom launcher (like Nova Launcher) affects things.
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - +91 86559 19035: Nope it won't
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
05/06/2020, 4:10 pm - +91 86559 19035: When You set a wallpaper it is set in your system even if the app crashes the wallpaper won't change since you set it and there starts the loop crashes
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The issue is that the system restarts the home process, which crashes, then restarts, then crashes, etc.
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - +91 86559 19035: Loop yes
05/06/2020, 4:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If the wallpaper is a third party launcher, then the system will use the default home process.
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - +91 86559 19035: Go ahead try to install a launcher apply a wallpaper not that one and then uninstall the launcher the wallpaper stays the same
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - +91 86559 19035: Same matlab jo launcher se apply kiya tha
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): read the comments section😂
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): On my (Oppo) phone, whenever Nova Launcher crashes, the launcher changes to the system launcher, and the wallpaper resets.
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - +91 86559 19035: You may try applying your luck then
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definately NOT.
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is why I am asking someone to try in an emulator.
05/06/2020, 4:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Send this to Kajli ma'am @917738557601
05/06/2020, 4:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Problem solve tera😂
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I am not sure that she is capable of setting a wallpaper 😂.
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Downloading it is enough na
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, it has to be SET as a wallpaper.
05/06/2020, 4:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): * or displayed by the system in some manner, but then the system can just kill the task.
05/06/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'll try this when I get some time. Sounds like fun
If anything goes wrong, nandroid backup wtg 😂
05/06/2020, 4:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): All of you know how to use an emulator, right?
05/06/2020, 4:55 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yup
05/06/2020, 4:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then WHY do you want to experiment on your phone?
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Because I want to wipe it anyway before I permanently switch to Paranoid Android so might as well try this out
Plus this doesn't crash all phones so who knows 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK that makes sense.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I prefer Lineange OS.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Lineage is too plain for my taste 😂😂
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: Also a nandroid backup is an ultimate backup so it's nothing more than a simple experiment
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then try Resurrection Remix (RR).
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: That's outdated. No Q build either
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I know, but it is still better to NOT brick your phone.
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: RR hasn't been updated for a very long time actually
05/06/2020, 5:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: I've bricked mine wayyy too many times 😂😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: Even had to go to stores to replace the motherboard a couple of times
05/06/2020, 5:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://get.resurrectionremix.com/?dir=ten
05/06/2020, 5:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Very few devices are supported, but you can find unofficial roms on androidfilehost.com
05/06/2020, 5:05 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know that already buddy
05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: And I don't want to build on my own so I'm just avoiding it
05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 88798 05171: rr is pretty old now, devs stopped compiling it because it was pretty unstable
05/06/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: and obv new roms came out which were better
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: I spoke to Akhil Narang who has a big contribution in RR and he said the same thing
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: The best ROM imo is AOSiP
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Nothing beats it
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 88798 05171: ive been into this shit since galaxy y😂
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Well, the last build was on 1 June, so I don't know.
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Same 😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Why wouldn't they merge the security patch and release it instead? 🤔
05/06/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: Omg same phone same story 😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: I think galaxy young or something it was called
05/06/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 99693 94098: I guess most people started with samsung. Mostly because of shitty TouchWiz 😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya... I know luckily one ui is still shitty but much better
05/06/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 88798 05171: ^^
05/06/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 88798 05171: and then comes miui
05/06/2020, 5:12 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Y'all talking some high shit,

05/06/2020, 5:23 pm - +91 99693 94098: Use password for your recovery and you're done. What more security would you ever need?
05/06/2020, 5:24 pm - +91 99693 94098: There was a themer called good lock or something. That was the best thing that came out if samsung at that time 😂
05/06/2020, 5:35 pm - +91 97681 67131: I think was part of Samsung theme park/manager whatever they called... 😂
05/06/2020, 5:36 pm - +91 99693 94098: Oh the things samsung did to hide their shit 😂😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:39 pm - +91 97681 67131: Future of Futchia OS seems nice now but biggest issue is unlike android which works on Linux based kernel it works on Google made custom microkernel I think which makes providing apps on App Store difficult if google is able to nail the process of transfer of apps it would be replacing android then...
05/06/2020, 5:40 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya... a lot don’t use google chrome browser use our Samsung browser.. don’t use EA file explorer use Samsung files and so on lots of dual apps too... 😂
05/06/2020, 5:44 pm - +91 99693 94098: Not to mention all of Samsung's assistants 😂
05/06/2020, 5:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): S. Voice was the shittiest.
05/06/2020, 5:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Bixby was promising, but 
Google Assistant ruled the assistant world.
05/06/2020, 5:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya... remember now it lacked basic core reminder setting features too 😂 Bixby is much better in comparison..
05/06/2020, 5:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah 😂
05/06/2020, 5:46 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂

05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No matter, how much ever shitty Samsung is,
I'd always prefer Samsung over MIUI or Huawei or any other crappy Chinese OS
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
05/06/2020, 5:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): What happened to Freedom 257 thing😂
05/06/2020, 5:49 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I used Mi a while back,
It fkin showed ads in settings and recent app 🙄😂
05/06/2020, 5:49 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oooh the scandal
05/06/2020, 5:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes,it turns out it was some shitty Chinese phone
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The worst scandal going on rn is the Escobar Inc. Wala 😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Google it once 
And see
MKBHD's & Mr. Who's The Boss's video
05/06/2020, 5:50 pm - +91 97681 67131: Agreed... but not for that alone, Samsung’s r and d team is awesome no fold would have been possible without Samsung and there would be no edge/curved display devices without them they keep competition going if only Apple were there... u know 😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeahh
05/06/2020, 5:51 pm - +91 97681 67131: Saw re.. They are biggest scam
05/06/2020, 5:52 pm - +91 99693 94098: True. Mi is so shit that you have to ask for their permission for bootloader unlock and uske baad bhi you have to wait for a minimum of 15days before you can actually do it. Biggest scam ever
05/06/2020, 5:53 pm - +91 97681 67131: I loved their irony buying ripapple.com and rip Samsung.com and selling their refurbished phones only by rebranding them😂😂
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 88798 05171: But they have everything you want
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 97681 67131: These days I think all phones do it started by moto and Lenovo but it improves Androids privacy by having a locked bootloader it’s actually good as it makes hard to exploit a device with locked bootloader
05/06/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 88798 05171: There's no developement for op7
05/06/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 88798 05171: Its my first unrooted phone😂
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: 15 days wait time for a phone that I bought? Why can't I just unlock it immediately if I want to? Your device is linked to your mi account anyway so there's no way anyone else can do it
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: There is so much development for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know like 3-4 main devs that develop for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Thats for pro
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Nahi nahi
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Been a while I've checked XDA
05/06/2020, 5:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Karle. Kaafi saare ROMs hai OP7 ke liye
05/06/2020, 5:59 pm - +91 88798 05171: Jab mene dekha tha tab lineage tak nahi tha
05/06/2020, 6:01 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know op7 ka PE dev. Baalaji. He used to develop for my device before
05/06/2020, 6:01 pm - +91 97681 67131: Moto and pixel give code immediately though. See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that’s the reason locked bootloader are better
05/06/2020, 6:02 pm - +91 97681 67131: Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back
05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 88798 05171: tele group nikal na op7 ka, xda doesnt even have an official lineage thread
05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know this re 😂😂
I'm saying that all phones have a security check before you can unlock(some kind of login or something) so no random person can do it. If you're giving your login credentials and you're still not able to unlock the bootloader immediately then what's the use? 
Flashing a custom recovery, etc comes much later. ADB doesn't allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader
05/06/2020, 6:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7/development/rom-lineageos-17-1-t4109353
05/06/2020, 6:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: Infact I know this guy as well. Pro dev hai 😂😂
05/06/2020, 6:06 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya... now providing what moto calls unique key for bootloader unlocking that’s up to manufacturer re. Before doing that they have too check if device has valid purchase date etc now moto does it on site and gives code immediately I have never tried on mi device that’s issue with xiomi
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Shit going above head again 😂
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 99693 94098: That's much better imo
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: 1 saal hogaya twrp nahi dekha hoga
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 99693 94098: Try orangefox if your device has it. 10x better than twrp
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: ye kab aaya😂
05/06/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 97681 67131: ?
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 97681 67131: Orange fox?
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 88798 05171: might be a recovery
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Rip I guess op7 doesn't have it
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 97681 67131: It would have pixel experience rom see that’s a lot popular on one plus devices these days
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: It's literally one step away from being a ROM itself 😂😂
Bas wifi and data connectivity daalde and done
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes PE is amazing
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: Never heard much I think twrp and clockwork mod ruled the game back in the days
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): +1
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 88798 05171: hardlly anyone does these stuff on op devices
05/06/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 99693 94098: It's got a plus version as well jismei limited features bhi hai
05/06/2020, 6:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ha 😂
05/06/2020, 6:10 pm - +91 99693 94098: That was long back
05/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I will search all of these today for sure
05/06/2020, 6:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know re... not using android so stop this kand these days.. 😂 and issue with jailbreaking is Apple keeps pushing iOS updates so quickly that the the exploit becomes useless. Hence xda article on why jailbreaking community is dying
05/06/2020, 6:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Pehli baar kucj smjha😌
05/06/2020, 6:12 pm - +91 99693 94098: Ask them to update safari ffs 😂😂
All web devs are crying because safari doesn't support half of the things
05/06/2020, 6:13 pm - +91 97681 67131: They don’t care truly and actually btw safari has web inspector on Mac though not as good as chrome developer tools nowhere near actually 😂😂😂
05/06/2020, 6:15 pm - +91 88798 05171: pe has v limited customisations na
05/06/2020, 6:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I like the design of the FireFox devtools more.
But Chrome devtools has some great features.
05/06/2020, 6:16 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes. Like Lineage
05/06/2020, 6:17 pm - +91 88798 05171: not for me then
05/06/2020, 6:17 pm - +91 99693 94098: Apparently Henrique ported face unlock for Q from some moto phone and moto sent him a notice 😂😂
Uske baad se abhi koi moto ke phones ko bhaav nahi de raha
05/06/2020, 6:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yup.. chrome is best Never tried Firefox accept on all Linux distros
05/06/2020, 6:20 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know... issue with moto is that only walls are built very high I was reading this article on sim unlocking on moto USA devices apparently I guy wrote a python script that gave the unique key for such device and was sued by moto.. he stoped now
05/06/2020, 6:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 6:21 pm - +91 99693 94098: One plus is great in that sense. Source code nahi denge but jo masti karna hai karlo 😂

05/06/2020, 6:22 pm - +91 99693 94098: OOS is pretty sorted I feel. Atleast when compared to memeui
05/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I don't like iOS anyways. Too limited.
05/06/2020, 6:23 pm - +91 88798 05171: looks fine but has a lot of bugs
05/06/2020, 6:23 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ha... it’s gr8 cause oneplus since oneplus one was fan of custom roms it was first kem device time come out of the box with cynagen mod custom rom but they and cynogen had some fight so started using their own custom build
05/06/2020, 6:24 pm - +91 99693 94098: I've only used ports and I've seen only one problem of massive battery drainage. I can't comment because utna use nahi kiya hai maine tbh

05/06/2020, 6:26 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yup agreed limited... standalone iOS is useless but nobody in world makes every device such as laptop, phone, tablet make a good in hardware and make such gr8 software experience connecting them together with features like airplay handoff etc like Apple but I hate them in many ways too 😂

10/06/2020, 6:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But why are linux and mac considered better than windows for programming purposes🤔!?
10/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Linux is pretty nice.
10/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Because it is not bloated with BS
10/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): What do you use for development?
10/06/2020, 6:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Windows 
Will be setting up dual boot soon
10/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Don't dual boot
10/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Use wsl
10/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I too use windows
10/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh
10/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why
10/06/2020, 6:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Windows mai what problems do you face
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Any one is fine tbh.
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Why lol
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): What i think it's because linux support some functionality which inbuilt for easy working
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): +1
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Like?
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Unless you want to build for ios😂
10/06/2020, 6:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Lol
10/06/2020, 6:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh that's a different ball game altogether
10/06/2020, 6:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Postman
10/06/2020, 6:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Download the GUI for Windows. Where's the hassle!?
10/06/2020, 6:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Idk i also use windows for building😅
10/06/2020, 6:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Same lol
10/06/2020, 6:15 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This is what i have heard
10/06/2020, 6:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes me too
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I mean go ahead, it's your choice.

Also, WSL2 is out (if you've updated to Win 10 version 2004), so you can start using the new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with it and also use the new Windows Terminal.

Hmu if you need any help with that. I have done it myself and have gists with all the reqd links and stuff...
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Do you make gists for everything you do?
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ohh great
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll hit you up in 3 days
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Documentation is VERY important!
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Personally, could not recommed Docker highly enough.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I'm not really good md😅
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MUCH better than WSL, as you can have separate, disposable containers.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh yeah even Docker is amazing and it's supported via a nice GUI if you've updated to Win 10 version 2004.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Docker has started supporting Win 10 Home as well
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, that is with VirtualBox.
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I think they did away with that in the 2004 version. Not sure though...
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But updataing to Pro is trivial.

https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/KMS-activator
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 10/10 would recommend.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Especially if you want to work with large projects.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah I never said that you should upgrade to Pro
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Explain this is simple terms lol
10/06/2020, 6:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Windows has an in-built mechanic to check activation with *any* Key Management Server (KMS).
This is usually used in corporate enviorments where internet access is a security issue.
But you can setup a KMS server ON THE SAME PC and Windows will happily ask the server if the liscence is still valid.
10/06/2020, 6:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Is it like piracy?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh lol 😂
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Why have they not done something to solve it!?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the exchange goes like this:
Windows to Server: Is my license still valid?
Server to Windows: Of course! 😉
Windows: OK then.
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): 😂
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but you are not modifying the software, just using in-built mechanisms in un-intended ways.
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ironically it is hosted on GitHub😂😂
10/06/2020, 6:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes. But not a lot of people know about this or have the patience to read the README.
10/06/2020, 6:34 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): 😅
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That will be VERY difficult, since Microsoft mainly relys on the backwords-compatibility of Windows. Otherwise all businesses would have switched to Linux.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can actually run a Windows 98 program on Windows 10 and it shoud run fine.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): PS: This works for Office as well.

I have built a To Do list website, hosted at: https://tusharjustdoit.netlify.app/

It is definitely open source, you can check out the code at: https://github.com/tusharnankani/ToDoList
12/06/2020, 9:31 am - Tushar Nankani: The mobile view is still under construction, I would recommend to view it on your PCs. Or in desktop mode, if you're viewing it on your mobile phones.

Would love to receive everyone's feedback. And some constructive criticism, so the website can be built better!

12/06/2020, 10:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Dude why don't you use an IDE like IntelliJ ,it will be easier to debug then
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): int x is not declared
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): X is not defined inside prime
12/06/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
12/06/2020, 10:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Actually, he is doing a great job.
12/06/2020, 10:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes getting used to command line...but as a beginner better to use an IDE like BlueJ
12/06/2020, 10:38 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But no one is going to tell you that their should be written in a notepad or something
12/06/2020, 10:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I too like to use the command line for simple programs, but USE AN EDITOR.
Notepad++ is a good standalone editor. So is VSCode.
But DON'T USE NOTEPAD.
12/06/2020, 10:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
12/06/2020, 10:40 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): IDE's help you a lot!!!
12/06/2020, 10:43 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Exactly 
You don't want the beginner to get too much help
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Then you use Bluej
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its just perfect,just like a text editor,no auto-complete
12/06/2020, 10:46 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Why??🙄😶
12/06/2020, 10:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The beginner should be able to figure it out himself, where he went wrong 
Rather than the ide just helping him fix the errors
12/06/2020, 10:47 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ide does show you the errors
12/06/2020, 10:53 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And getting stuck at such a trivial issues is so demotivating for a beginner
12/06/2020, 10:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is true
12/06/2020, 11:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I know 
Been there....
But, 
I also used an IDE only....
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But I realized, in order to get perfect....
I would have done better if I had done it on a simple text editor
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Do watch Tech With Tim's video on this topic
12/06/2020, 11:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/oij82Cp9K1A
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I feel that 
Immediate help is harmful
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Notepad++ provides only syntax highlighting. I think that is a quite helpfully, especially for a beginner.
12/06/2020, 11:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bluej is the best for beginners imo,we used that in school too
12/06/2020, 11:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not using an IDE is like learning to ride a bike without training wheels.
Yes, it is possible but there is no major benefit.
12/06/2020, 11:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True that
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Which language?
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Python
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): C++
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I find Python impossible to code without an IDE.
Especially without a mononspace font. I really don't like the syntax.
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ahh
I know that😅😅
12/06/2020, 11:20 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Python have a really steep learning curve for people from another language which have brackets
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): It's very hard to get used to those whitespaces
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Its not just the whitespaces, Python has vary strange behaviour.
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *very.
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ik😂
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I cannot do ```"I have " + 5 + " Apples"```.
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 🤣
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I call a function with missing arguments?
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): 😂😂
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Im uncomfortable with Python syntax fr🤣
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): JAVA ALLOWS THIS.
C++ ALLOWS THIS.
BOTH ARE MORE STRONGLY TYPED THAN PYTHON.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And initializing multi-dimension arrays is horrible.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If you are using a statically typed language ide helps a lot
12/06/2020, 11:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you are using a ~statically typed~ language ide helps a lot.
12/06/2020, 11:26 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And i can't find a reason of not using an ide if you are always going to use an ide
12/06/2020, 11:26 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Y'all, hating python so much makes me sad 
🥺🥺
👉🏻👈🏻👉🏻👈🏻
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Python has a statement to do nothing.
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Aww we don't hate you😂
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Watch the video
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): .
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Thanks!
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I watched this
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Idk why but I really hate Python
12/06/2020, 11:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Dream come true😂
Now, to do nothing also, I'm accounted for 😂
12/06/2020, 11:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Another disadvantage that its Dynamically typed
12/06/2020, 11:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is a good learning experience, you should know how to compile programs.
Syntax hilighing is a different story.
There is no good reason to not use syntax hilighting.
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I have literally seen solutions in Perl which kill a huge solution in a line
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): On codeforces
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I never wrote a line of code without an ide but still ik what error I'm getting. What i feel is that learning a language takes time but demotivating yourself of by getting stuck at simple issues is not acceptable.
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is less about the error and more about knowing how to work with simple tools.
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I gave example of error
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Syntax highlighting is necessary 
But, 
Autocomplete nahi yaar...
I've grown so used to it
That 
I keep forgetting the syntax
12/06/2020, 11:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Except in certain circumstances (Static code analysis), all the IDE does is display the error thrown by the compiler in a different way.
You should know how to read throught logs and error messages to find what is relevant.
12/06/2020, 11:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its a nightmare to read the logs
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ganda hai par dhanda hai😂😂
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > I keep forgetting the syntax
There is NO GOOD REASON to remember syntax. Can you remember every word in the dictionary? Then why do you want to memorize an entire language

12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I agree 
That coding is about 
How better your Googling Skills are....

But for the sake of efficiency
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If, we have this rigid practice of typing out the whole code.....
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): For projects,hell no
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then, couple that with the autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This makes it faster
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Couple the practice with autocomplete 
Your efficiency increases ×3
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Exactly
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Obviously

12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If, we get used to autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then we won't learn the language
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Properly
12/06/2020, 11:43 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Bhai but you will always have autocomplete

12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): @918451904417 if you are going to learn a new language are you going to use notepad again?

14/06/2020, 1:57 pm - Prithvi Rohira (TSEC, CS): I wasn't able to link sublime text with the command prompt after downloading node JS.
However now I can do it
14/06/2020, 3:45 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If you're talking about having an inbuilt terminal in Sublime Text, maybe https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31439023/sublime-text-3-integrated-terminal/55484753#55484753 will help you.

I would suggest switching to VS Code for web dev though. Lmk if you want links to set up VS Code (extensions and stuff).
14/06/2020, 5:03 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): Vs code lit
14/06/2020, 5:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes!

Keep asking!
25/06/2020, 11:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): He told project-based will help you a lot in the long run.
You might miss out on the nitty gritties of the particular language. But that's fine.
For beginners, what should do is, find a course which teaches by walking through a particular project. That would be really beneficial.
25/06/2020, 11:37 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Definitely agree with this!

Get started with a quick tutorial and then learn as per requirements...

26/06/2020, 10:46 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But remember,
Chrome was the first browser to bring the concept of Threading. 
That means if multiple tabs are open, and if one tab hangs, rest all work.
Before that, in firefox, if there are 10 tabs open and if 1 tab also stops working 
It used to crash the browser. 
Everyone else copied.
26/06/2020, 10:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ah get it
26/06/2020, 10:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Multithreading?

26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah, but people are slowly migrating imo.

Brave, Edge, Firefox and some of the popular ones...

I personally use Edge because Microsoft atleast optimizes its perf (even though it is Chromium)
26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Are*
26/06/2020, 12:04 pm - +91 86559 19035: Yeah True

26/06/2020, 12:33 pm - +91 80979 84068: Hi guys! 

So I was thinking most of us want to start with ML ,DAta science , AI but don’t exactly know where to start from, so I’m forming a group where we’ll start working on projects together . We’ll start with v basic projects starting from Python ke basics and will go on aage (ITS OKAY IF YOU DON’T KNOW MUCH WE ALL ARE LEARNING HERE ) 

- we will refer to 1YouTube video focusing on 1 project for a week and try to make and learn on our own . 
- if we don’t understand any concept or anything from the video we’lltry to reverse engineer it and help others in the group as well.

People who are interested can join this group

 You all can share it with people if you want

 Also I was thinking it’ll be great if we put up our projects on GitHub as it’ll help us keep a record of our progress so Harsh Kapadia⁩ has decided to help us with Git and GitHub. He will be taking a live hands on session tomorrow(ie Sunday)
and I have posted a poll  regarding the same there please join the group and vote so we know when to keep the session

28/06/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 75078 05454: This looks interesting. But it looks like a customisable yet limited platform specifically created for development of apps for internal business use something like a project management app.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 75078 05454: It's an interesting move of Amazon's part. They are trying to migrate people who are using Google docs or microsoft excel to this platform which is powered by AWS.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): How exactly/
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is an app development platform, right?
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not an Excel or Google Sheets clone.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Businesses use spreadsheets for managing projects that is what they are trying to replace.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Not something like data analysis or financial analysis done using spreadsheets
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 75078 05454: They are basically trying to solve the problem of using spreadsheets where they are not supposed to be conventionally used .
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, that makes some sense.
28/06/2020, 9:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍👍
28/06/2020, 9:37 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): Never thought would see this day😂
28/06/2020, 9:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *Some* sense. I am still not completely sure if that is the real goal.
28/06/2020, 9:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂
28/06/2020, 9:40 pm - +91 80979 84068: 😂

28/06/2020, 9:53 pm - +91 75078 05454: What is your opinion?
28/06/2020, 10:02 pm - +91 75078 05454: The real goal is definitely not to be an excel clone but to provide an effective way of creating apps for internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): My point exactly.
28/06/2020, 10:04 pm - +91 75078 05454: But they are going to have a huge advantage once the entire company moves to their platform for all internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): While this is certainly possible, I don't think that this is the first use-case to come to mind.
28/06/2020, 10:05 pm - +91 75078 05454: ?
28/06/2020, 10:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean that it is possible to do data-analysis and manage projects on the platform, but that is not what I would use the platform for.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I would use it for rapid prototypes and proof of concepts.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's definitely a very good use case but depends on the capability of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:09 pm - +91 75078 05454: From their campaign it looks like a platform for making apps for internal operations for businesses
28/06/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 75078 05454: But there is definitely a possibility of that turning into something like WordPress
28/06/2020, 10:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I feel that Wordpress gained it's popularity because it was so open.
28/06/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's what I am saying the range of use cases will depend upon the flexibility of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is true.
28/06/2020, 10:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I don't think that companies will be willing to trust Amazon with their business logic.
28/06/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 75078 05454: Yeah that's true
28/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Same. Even I was surprised when I read that 😂

spelling of SCHOOL is

 SCHOOL
and not SCHOOL

Some people write the second O before the 1st O and it is incorrect

Mujhe decimal point ke baad 1000 numbers chahiye for example toh kaise karu
01/07/2020, 5:14 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): F aaisa kya kar raha hai?
01/07/2020, 5:14 pm - +91 75078 05454: Yeh competition ka question hai naa?
01/07/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 73043 57388: Yes
01/07/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 73043 57388: Actually i am getting

Only 5 numbers after . Point
01/07/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 75078 05454: I tried by importing Decimal in python
01/07/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 99204 26955: try fixed and set precision I guess
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ya but it seems they are only used while printing a double number

I wanna store number

01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 75078 05454: I converted it to a string
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You will have to use arrays.
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Or a string.
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): hmm
01/07/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 73043 57388: Yes we will convert it to a string but first the numbers p and q are divided then their result is stored in string
01/07/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 73043 57388: I even used long double but still doesn't getting more than 5 digits
01/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You will have to do the division process in small small steps
01/07/2020, 5:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And store the number decimal by decimal by appending the string.
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There was a similar problem on code chef
Where you had to find the factorial of numbers > 21 
Suppose you have to calculate 100!
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You have to write a special algorithm for division
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): correct
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): simulate the division process
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I have the solution for this.
You can read and then write the required algorithm for division.
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yess.
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): and keep adding
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Arre sir ye kese karneka?
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Vo explain karna mushkil hai
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Thanks
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Code mujhe bhi bejhna
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Imagine you have to divide using pen and paper
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Usko algorithm me dalna hai
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Idhar hi bhej rha hu
01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Remainder waise sab karke

01/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Samjh gaya
01/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): use BigInteger
01/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): like how the computer internally does right?
01/07/2020, 5:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): https://blog.codechef.com/2009/07/02/tutorial-for-small-factorials/
01/07/2020, 5:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): See this.
This is algorithm for multiplying.
01/07/2020, 5:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Read the full thing.
It will help you a lot while writing algorithm for division.
01/07/2020, 5:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No.
Like a human does.
01/07/2020, 5:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Won't work.
01/07/2020, 5:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 100! Has 158 digits.
01/07/2020, 5:39 pm - +91 73043 57388: Got that
I used setprecision with cout
01/07/2020, 5:39 pm - +91 73043 57388: BUT Still getting WA
01/07/2020, 5:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You tried writing the division algorithm?
01/07/2020, 5:41 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ya tried but not so good
01/07/2020, 5:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then need to make it efficient.
01/07/2020, 5:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): int n;

01/07/2020, 5:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918080142783  you have read the whole Orcale documentation or what!?
01/07/2020, 5:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example: Node.

01/07/2020, 5:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Aare aise baat nahi hai.
01/07/2020, 5:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Python actually goes one step further, all intergers are automatically converted to bigints when they get larger than 32 bits.
```>>> f = 1
>>> for i in range(2, 101):
...     f *= i
...
>>> f

01/07/2020, 5:59 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This makes programmers ignore this fact that all programs don't do this and thus create negative currency
01/07/2020, 6:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is BAD.

Please let me know.

06/07/2020, 6:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I need 
p2p guidabce
06/07/2020, 6:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): thats why asking
06/07/2020, 6:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): *guidance
06/07/2020, 7:25 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ohhhh
06/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It would be better if you can tell us what exactly you are trying to do.
06/07/2020, 8:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm trying to create tables.

For example, if I do it normally, in MySQL, I can use foreign key to links 2 tables.

I want to understand 
How to do that using classes in Python. 

But, never mind, I'll look it up and experiment so that, understand.
06/07/2020, 8:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I was looking for a shortcut, like if someone has done it, I would have just asked how, but I'll do it on my own only.

Thanks anyways 😅
06/07/2020, 8:59 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): There is a field called ForeignKey in django models, which works exactly like the Foreign key in SQL
06/07/2020, 11:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I had a question,is there any harm in putting semicolon at the end of every statement in MySQL?
06/07/2020, 11:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): or can some1 just tell me when are semi-colons reqd. in SQL,I am kinda confused with this as  I saw tutorials where they almost never use it
06/07/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 82916 21138: Actually semicolon is used to end a query.
06/07/2020, 11:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes got it now'
07/07/2020, 12:11 am - Vivek Iyer (TSEC, Biomed): In python u can use range function to create table
07/07/2020, 12:11 am - Vivek Iyer (TSEC, Biomed): Tables*
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^[^aeiou]
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): can any1 explain what this means in SQL
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): its a regex
07/07/2020, 1:24 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No no,
I'm talking about Django 
Class based SQL tables for backend
07/07/2020, 1:48 am - Tushar Nankani: This type of regex probably means it should start with _aeiou._
07/07/2020, 1:51 am - Tushar Nankani: And it should probably be ```^[aeiou]```. I am not too sure.
07/07/2020, 1:55 am - Tushar Nankani: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/regexp.html#operator_regexp

07/07/2020, 1:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But this is for the not starting with either od a,e,i,o or u
07/07/2020, 1:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): of*
07/07/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): There was a problem on hackerrank to select names of cities from a table with should not start or end with a vowel and this worked
07/07/2020, 2:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If the first character of a class is ^ then it negates the class.

07/07/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Great site for learning regex.

07/07/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): No put it only at the and of the query
07/07/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): end*
07/07/2020, 12:46 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍
07/07/2020, 6:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): What is the difference between these two:
$ touch README.md
$ notepad README.md
07/07/2020, 6:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): With reference to git bash
07/07/2020, 6:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): touch will create a 0 length file called README.md.
notepad will open README.md in notepad.
07/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk👍

07/07/2020, 8:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically, TLE.
07/07/2020, 8:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The program did not compile/start on time.
07/07/2020, 8:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But it is not the program's fault.
07/07/2020, 9:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 9:19 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): I think you get that for interactive problems
07/07/2020, 9:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah when the program doesn't output anything
07/07/2020, 9:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Idleness limit exceeded occurs when your program stays idle (waiting for user/interaction program) for long time.

I'm not sure why is it not WA instead of Idleness limit exceeded. My guess is that interaction program expects a newline and thus keeps on waiting for your program.
07/07/2020, 9:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): cf blog
07/07/2020, 9:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>

I did git Init and then it came that it's been reinitialized
Then finally when I have to put the git remote add origin command it gives me an error

Fatal: remote origin already exists
07/07/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): it already has a repo on git hub
07/07/2020, 9:37 pm - +91 98670 44401: I deleted that repository but
07/07/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): push instead
07/07/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): maybe

07/07/2020, 9:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then do git pull
07/07/2020, 9:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is to define a new remote?
07/07/2020, 9:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, this is to CHANGE the url of the remote named "origin".
07/07/2020, 9:53 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk👍

07/07/2020, 9:53 pm - +91 98670 44401: No pull worked for some reason
07/07/2020, 9:54 pm - +91 98670 44401: Push gave an error

08/07/2020, 11:09 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I don't want anything, Tanay was looking for something to write his notes in.
I suggested either GitHub repos, GitHub Gists or just commenting the notes in shorthand in the tutorial project that he builds while watching the video side by side.
08/07/2020, 11:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean what do you mean by this?

10/07/2020, 5:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): .01 don't make much difference
10/07/2020, 5:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ohk
10/07/2020, 5:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But it is always good to upgrade🙃
10/07/2020, 5:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Unless it's windows update😂
10/07/2020, 5:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Depends. You should read the changelog and see if new features were added.
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): will check
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example git sparse-checkout was added in a 0.1 update.
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): oh
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And so was git switch and git restore.
10/07/2020, 5:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yaa but most of the time .01 is likely to be a bug fix
10/07/2020, 5:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, most of the time it is true.
10/07/2020, 5:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But somtimes features are added/changed from experimental to stable.
10/07/2020, 5:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Best way is to read the changelog.
10/07/2020, 5:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): U have sooo many things on your device it is very tough to read all the changelogs... especially for a person like who rarely updates😅
10/07/2020, 5:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Really?
10/07/2020, 5:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I like reading changelogs.
10/07/2020, 5:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And then trying out the new features.
10/07/2020, 5:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If it's in front of me then i read agar it's redirecting me to another webpage or something then I just let it update
10/07/2020, 5:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I do this with VSCode only.

10/07/2020, 6:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Focus on 1 thing at a time....
10/07/2020, 6:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don't jump around everything. 
I've tried and I've failed....
10/07/2020, 6:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): +1
10/07/2020, 6:34 pm - +91 82916 21138: +1
10/07/2020, 6:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Pick 1 thing and work on it until you have 3-4 projects on it.

10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): What is HomeBrew ? Is this for Mac only?
10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not technially, no.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It was developed as a package mangager for Mac.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): But what is HomeBrew?
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Similar to apt and apk.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Package manager like Linux has apt...
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Exactly.
10/07/2020, 7:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is also availiable for linux.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It has limited use, except in very rare situations.
One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Means you don't have to be root to install software.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can "isolate" brew to one directory and it will not touch anything outside that directory.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Are u trying to install git?? That’s why asking for home brew? For example if I needed to install git on OS X u can use home brew as ur package manager. This will automatically install all the Xcode command line tools recquired for git to run on ur mac
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Oh acha
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - +91 97681 67131: Thought so, I also did the same recently 😅. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I think you can just do ```git``` on the command line and it will propmpt for installation.
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeahh thats what i did
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - +91 97681 67131: I don’t think that works in terminal on OSX
10/07/2020, 7:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): not only git i did 'brew install git'

10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): loll
10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): XCode has old packages sometimes.
Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0.
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): I'll check
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): just a sec
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yup its 2.27.0
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Great!
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - +91 97681 67131: Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Thanks @918080142783 and @919768167131 !
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah abhi i got to know
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - +91 97681 67131: Anytime 😅
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Thanks
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Just a side note, dpkg is just a package installer, it will not download dependencies.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): apt uses dpkg internally.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): It went over my head lol
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya ya.. it’s installer sorry
10/07/2020, 7:42 pm - +91 97681 67131: But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right??
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies.
But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order.
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager.
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Ohhh

18/07/2020, 10:41 am - +91 82916 21138: The following order of learning would make sense.

Core Java - it is important to start with core Java for understanding the fundamental in Java programming.

Servlets - JSP and Servlet are important to understand the web technologies

Java EE

Spring Framework

Hibernate Framework



Java is a very vast language and used in various forms like Socket programming, Web Application development, Portal designing, Android applications, Purely Backend developments using Webservices and lot more. So first decide what you want to learn.

Learn accordingly.

1. Core Java : Most Important . Learn all the concepts don’t miss a single one. Its the heart and soul of Java

2. JSP and Servlet : These are basics of Web application development. Earlier all the applications were made using these technology but now they are just a part of Web development.

3. JDBC : You should be familiar with this concepts . Your daily life belongs to this only. Learn basics of SQL language also for CRUD operation.

4.Spring: The most useful framework which is used for various applications .

5.Hibernate: Its useful for DB interaction at the highest speed.

You can follow the 12345 all for a Spring web application development.

You can follow 1235 for Hibernate developer.

You can learn only 1 for Socket programming.

If you want to be a Android developer then learn only 1 and then proceed to android studio.

Except this you can learn JSF and Webservices for better knowledge and work

18/07/2020, 10:52 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Are 2 to 5 used a lot in the industry?
18/07/2020, 10:53 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah but don't say no if they aren't offering a stiped.
18/07/2020, 10:53 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): The experience will really help you!
18/07/2020, 10:55 am - +91 82916 21138: Yes I have heard in industries java spring and hibernate  is  used a lot I mean 2 to 5 cause it's old technology so slowly things are changing but still java is used in enterprise level applications .

19/07/2020, 10:26 am - +91 82916 21138: I found some good question and answer
19/07/2020, 10:26 am - +91 82916 21138: Prashasti Agarwal:
I am graduating this year and I have job offer of 3-4 LPA. Should I focus on preparing for GATE or for DSA and CP?

Satbir Singh:
It's your wish. Remember GATE will give one chance per year to prove your worth whereas if you do CP and you're prepared you can get many chance to attend various interviews.

Anurag Goel:
After doing GATE, you will be doing M.Tech and again focussing on coding skills, Cp and DSA  for placement season after 2 years. 

So it would be better if you switch your 3-4 lpa to 8-10+ lpa in product based company by learning those coding skills self. 
I've been exactly at the same position as you are today and can feel the dilemma but if job is the end goal, better to grind yourself now with DSA coding skills along with existing job.

19/07/2020, 12:44 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): And how did GitHub come to know?

19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Do you know about the Artic Seed Vault?
It's to protect the original seeds, because in these days, hybrid seeds ke vajha se original seeds are vanishing.

This code thing, I feel GitHub is just doing for publicity. 
Maybe, just a marketing stunt.
19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Lol
19/07/2020, 12:55 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yaa this is what i think😂😂

19/07/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes if app id is changed that u don't need to do make new project
19/07/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ok then
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Will have connect it again😓
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Very painful process as Android studio does a lot of nautanki
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Are you sure there is no other security concern?
19/07/2020, 2:15 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): @918080142783 any inputs?
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Vohi dekh raha hu
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Srsly needed
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Making a new project is the best option but this will be a lot of work
19/07/2020, 2:16 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Do this till then
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): If I make a new project then code will still be the same right?
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Only thing which important is app ID and API key
19/07/2020, 2:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Only I will have to set up the connection again?
19/07/2020, 2:18 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah and migrate app data in Firebase (idk how it's done though)
19/07/2020, 2:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nothing was there luckily

19/07/2020, 2:19 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Too much☹️,I better delete the project as there wasn't anything stored in
19/07/2020, 2:20 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Okk😂👍
19/07/2020, 2:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): If I delete the project then the JSON files in the former committs won't matter right,m

19/07/2020, 2:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Everything is connected as before,now I only need to add json file to .gitignore right?or something else?
19/07/2020, 2:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Or should I leave the json file out all together?
19/07/2020, 2:52 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I have my Firebase files in a private repo 🙈
19/07/2020, 2:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Hey this is nice, @918291679151!

My opinions:
- In mobile view, get the number pad above the operator pad
- Make the operators visible in the box.
- The press handling is a little difficult. (Idk how you can improve that...)

19/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Some suggestions:
- Add CSS transitions (literally 1 line of CSS)
- Adjust the padding so that there are no scrollbars (at least on Desktop)
- It is very bad practice for UI to shift. Make your buttons not shift on hover.

20/07/2020, 10:23 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Not a one time thing
This happens when you've already created a table in the database which has a few entries and now you try to add a new column
So what django is saying is that since the field you've given is non-nullable, django can't just give null value to it, and so, you'll have to assign a default value to all the existing entries in the table
20/07/2020, 10:33 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes correct. 
I just wanted to change.
Needed to add 2 columns

22/07/2020, 5:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```int largestPrimeFactor(int n){
    if(n <= 3)
        return n;
    
    int f = 1;
    while(n > 1){
        f++;
        while(n % f == 0)
            n /= f;
    }
    
    return f;
}```
22/07/2020, 5:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have to add logic to handle 0 and negative numbers.
22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ```
vector<int> divs;
int check(int x) {
    if(x <= 1) return -1;
    
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= x ; ++i) {
        if(x%i == 0) {
           divs.push_back(i);
           while(x % i == 0) {
               x = x / i;
           }
        }
    }
    
    if(divs.empty())divs.push_back(x);
    
    return divs.back();
}```
22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): try this
22/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 1. Java
2. No need for a vector
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): this will TLE if n is prime. But I think there isn't any time constraint on Udemy, so this will also work
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Lets say N is 10^9 + 7
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Use n = 5
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): your loop will run 10^9 + 7 times
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Easier.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And no.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Wait, is 10e9 + 7 prime?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yes it will
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): yeah
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Ah, then yes.
22/07/2020, 5:32 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Here I have optimized it. Consider any number N, if its not prime then it'll definitely have a factor <= sqrt(N)
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): so Time Complexity is O(sqrt(n))
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I was aiming for simplicity, but OK.
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah both solutions should work
22/07/2020, 5:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): CP wale sir💯
22/07/2020, 5:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919689727471

        if(x % i == 0) {
           f = i;

22/07/2020, 5:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): More efficient.

05/08/2020, 6:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, if you are ultimately including the file in the apk, then what is the point?

05/08/2020, 6:06 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If I can get the same information from the apk then it's OK to commit it to GitHub.

05/08/2020, 6:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): An apk file is essentially a .zip file.
05/08/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 97681 67131: Amazing Work @919967684479 🔥🔥🔥
05/08/2020, 6:07 pm - +91 99676 84479: Its not something that i am going to launch on play store😂 just made it for practice so
05/08/2020, 6:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So right click on an apk file and select "Open with...", then open with 7-zip, WinZip or WinRar.

05/08/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 99676 84479: Didn't know this way to extract APKs
05/08/2020, 6:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you are distributing the apk, then you are distributing the file.
05/08/2020, 6:09 pm - +91 99676 84479: Okayy got it

Mera ek query tha
Humlog json mei multiple objects ko array ke form mei store karte hai right

So mujhe har object ko retrive karke usko HTML pe div mei styling karna hai toh kaise karengay?
07/08/2020, 2:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Example?
07/08/2020, 2:10 pm - +91 73043 57388: Job listing
07/08/2020, 2:11 pm - +91 73043 57388: Now i have multiple jobs 

And data regarding each job has to be retrieved from JSON file and styled in different divs
07/08/2020, 2:12 pm - +91 70394 60876: Thanks man
07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So write a function to take the json data and create the required markup.
07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Have a for loop in the templating syntax that you're using and then add the necessary data in that
07/08/2020, 2:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 🤦‍♂️ WHY?
Throwing libraries at a problem is not the right thing to do.

The code is a little complex, but you should get the idea.

https://github.com/tusharnankani/Swadeshi/blob/master/frontend/farmer/script.js#L39-L56
07/08/2020, 2:18 pm - +91 73043 57388: So you have retrieved data from JSON?
07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917304357388 No, that is server side rendering.
07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The data is retrieved directly from the database.
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): But it is a JSON object that has been returned from the DB
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 73043 57388: Your are dynamically creating a HTML element?

Actually I was thinking about that exactly

Is it possible to dynamically create DIV element for each JSON object retrieved?
07/08/2020, 2:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): YES.
07/08/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 73043 57388: Thanks I will try
07/08/2020, 2:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK.

07/08/2020, 4:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Don't work with HTML directly.
07/08/2020, 4:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Use document.createElement and .appendChild instead.
07/08/2020, 4:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, you can first create a div, add all the children and the append it to the document once.

10/08/2020, 11:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Guys,
I've a question...
I have a localhost,
And I want to access it on another computer/phone/etc
Which is there on the same local network
10/08/2020, 11:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): How do I do that?
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Find your PC's (local) IP address.
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then go to that ip address + port number.
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If you are on wifi enable port forwarding
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And do this
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not needed.
10/08/2020, 11:58 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Aacha haa sorry
10/08/2020, 11:59 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There is a problem 
With that
10/08/2020, 11:59 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Port forwarding is if you want to access it out of the network
10/08/2020, 12:00 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Is say I have use VSCode ka live server 
It work.

But if I try to access Django ka local development server
It does not work

10/08/2020, 12:31 pm - +91 89764 07509: yes this step is correct but @918451904417 you will also have to add that ipaddress in allowed hosts in settings.py
10/08/2020, 12:32 pm - +91 89764 07509: and then in terminal give python manage.py (ip addr):8000
10/08/2020, 12:32 pm - +91 89764 07509: 8000 is what i use
10/08/2020, 12:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Side note: You can use ```py``` instead of typing ```python``` each time.

11/08/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 98337 26449: Then why does Google foobar only take submissions is java or python?
11/08/2020, 7:37 pm - +91 98337 26449: *in
11/08/2020, 8:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Google Foobar is rumoured to be a recruitment strategy of the past. It's still present as a challenge, but I've read that they've stopped recruiting through that.
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Maybe because its very popular and easy to learn
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: It still puts you in their radar. Or else they would've completely canned it.
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah maybe.
11/08/2020, 8:56 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Google is shifting from java because it have some licensing issues
11/08/2020, 8:57 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah I heard this too
11/08/2020, 8:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It was a stupid move by Oracle imo. They're killing off Java...
11/08/2020, 8:59 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And Flutter can never replace native...it is true google is try to push kotlin through it.
11/08/2020, 9:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
11/08/2020, 9:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But the fuchsia OS will be totally flutter based right!?
11/08/2020, 9:08 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Will it be able to take over most popular OS?
11/08/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 82916 21138: 🤔 interesting question tbh maybe I heard they are filling all gaps of android and making it
11/08/2020, 9:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I have already told this but think of replacing millions of android devices
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah  it will be gradual process but still 😅 maybe fuchsia becomes new update of android and from there on things change or something like that 🤔
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like android has already started removing some stuff
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This can never happen...
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah ik
11/08/2020, 9:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: I mean android is changing although so maybe idk who knows the future 😅
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Just don't want to be with an obsolete skill thats it😅😂
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean native android dev
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): What if it becomes obsolete at the end of 4 years
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Changing a os means bye bye to your data
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Nhi hoga bhai
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 🙏🙏
11/08/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa
11/08/2020, 9:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Android 4.4 bhi use kar rahe hai log 😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah ik but I mean  they will declare last version of android and then declare after this it will be Fuchsian
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): No not gonna happen
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like and Android's last version might look similar to Fuchsian maybe  kind of like that so smooth switch 🤔
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Leaving support for millions of devices is not simple and thing they can do as a company
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: True
11/08/2020, 9:26 pm - +91 82916 21138: 🤔 yeah true thing but what I read is that they are planning to make something which all iot device etc can use etc so don't know
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Kaha se aate aise idea?
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definately not.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can change you OS without loosing your data.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): As long as it is implemented properly.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If I flash a custom rom for it's recommended for a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): **recommended**
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And that is because they don't know what your previous OS was.
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yaa i tried not to and it gave me errors while boot so i did a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): 9 to 10 and the stock was released on 9
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you know which OS the phone is running, and you have can push (signed) OTA updates, you can do almost anything.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, this is a custom rom.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Don't you think fuchsia will have totally different file structure and permissions?
11/08/2020, 9:31 pm - +91 82916 21138: 🤔 maybe true
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes can be
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even if they do, it is trivial to copy over all data from the old locations to the new one.
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): App data?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fuchsia won't be Linux based right?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now app data, I agree, will be quite difficult to port.
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And will OEMs will do it😂🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But most apps backup to the cloud anyways, so 🤷‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I still don't have officially Android 10🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): You rooted your phone for android 10!?
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes and bricked it
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂😂🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Now?
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): You can't support only *some* apps
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - +91 82916 21138: 🤦‍♂️🤣XDA forum ?
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even if they don't save to cloud, you can usually export settings to a file.
11/08/2020, 9:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Service center😂
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But you can still get the former OS right
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean its not a permanent brick
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - +91 82916 21138: 🤣🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Fastboot was crashing
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F
11/08/2020, 9:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): You got stuck on bootloop?
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can do a complete firmware restore for most phones.
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yup with crashed fastboot
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I did it for mine.
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I was unable to access twrp and fastboot was crashing
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I would like to flash a custom ROM in my purana phone😂
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, even then.
11/08/2020, 9:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It runs on Android 6
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): How?? I tried anything which was available on XDA
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): How can I do it @917738557601
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): XDA😂
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): How did you unlock the bootloader,m
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is like flashing the phone in the factory.
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Some have a simple one line command
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nexus
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And google's phones
11/08/2020, 9:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Samsung hai mera
11/08/2020, 9:38 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yaa but you need to type command on fastboot na
11/08/2020, 9:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917738557601 Look up (MTR) Droid tools.
11/08/2020, 9:38 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Okk
11/08/2020, 9:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This seems weird but I want to see how a bricked phone looks like😂
11/08/2020, 9:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, image how phones are flashed during manufacturing.
11/08/2020, 9:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *this is
11/08/2020, 9:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It looks like a working phone but doesn't turn on.

11/08/2020, 9:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 🤦‍♂️😂

11/08/2020, 9:42 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I don't know how they fixed but I'm happy they fixed it😂
11/08/2020, 9:43 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Whenever i type any command on fastboot it restarts the device
11/08/2020, 9:43 pm - +91 99693 94098: Which device?
11/08/2020, 9:43 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ek ek error screen tha which only said press power button to restart
11/08/2020, 9:44 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Asus zenfone max pro m2😂😂
11/08/2020, 9:44 pm - +91 99693 94098: What commands did you try?
11/08/2020, 9:45 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): List devices
11/08/2020, 9:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/development/guide-fixing-hard-bricks-t3403868/amp/
11/08/2020, 9:45 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And tried to flash the custom rom
11/08/2020, 9:45 pm - +91 82916 21138: XDA is bae
11/08/2020, 9:46 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): XDA and community both couldn't help ne with this😂🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:46 pm - +91 99693 94098: Did you try overwriting the recovery partition?
11/08/2020, 9:46 pm - +91 82916 21138: I had put another os in my old phone using XDA twrp use kiya usse phele phone unlock Kiya and Kiya mast clear Kiya etc
11/08/2020, 9:46 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Your juna tab?

11/08/2020, 9:47 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Lol
11/08/2020, 9:47 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): So the mistake i did was that twrp didn't supported restore for android 10 and without knowing this is tried to restore app data
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): So you can't get android 10 in anyway?
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: I had put resurrection remix
11/08/2020, 9:48 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa twrp plays tweaks like that
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): You can why not?
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But why you couldn't? didn't get it?
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - +91 99693 94098: Big F. Should've used a compatible twrp. If you could overwrite the recovery with a compatible version, you could've fixed the issue
11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Did you lose all app data?
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: Android 10 has scoped storage so you can't directly shift data
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Again you couldn't execute any command in fastboot... this was first thing that i tried
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I want to try to go from Android 6 to Android 10 on my old phone,will definitely try😂
11/08/2020, 9:51 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): What are TOT file?
11/08/2020, 9:52 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'm not sure about the zenfone tbh but there are fastboot roms. That would be my first step actually. Anyway, as long as you got it fixed 😂🙌🏼
11/08/2020, 9:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically driver files.
11/08/2020, 9:53 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Fastboot roms?
11/08/2020, 9:55 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): <Media omitted>
11/08/2020, 9:55 pm - +91 99693 94098: Fastboot flashable ROMs. As I said I'm not sure of zenfone but devices like samsung and miui have Odin and miui flash tool
11/08/2020, 9:56 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I tried the official asus flash toolkit but it required to run in fastboot
11/08/2020, 9:56 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But I can't execute any commands on fastboot🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 9:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): WHAT?
11/08/2020, 9:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then what have I been using???
11/08/2020, 9:57 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Idk😂
11/08/2020, 9:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: It's a bit different than a simple fastboot command but it's fine
11/08/2020, 10:01 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Now the have locked my fastboot i might reflash the stock rom and restore the original fastboot file and again flash a custom rom😂😅🤦‍♂️
11/08/2020, 10:03 pm - +91 99693 94098: 🤪💪😂
11/08/2020, 10:07 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Could someone please help me by explaining difference between a 1tb SATA and 1tb HDD Hard disk? Which one is better suited for a gaming laptops.
11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You mean a 1TB SSD and 1TB HDD?
11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Are you sure?
11/08/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A 1TB SSD is *not* cheap.
11/08/2020, 10:10 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Yeah
11/08/2020, 10:11 pm - Tushar Nankani: 1TB SATA is 1 TB SSD?
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Tushar Nankani: According to what I have read, for gaming laptops, 512 SSD and 4 GB graphic card would work the best.
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Wait I am confused. What I have seen mostly are the ones with 1TB hddand 256 GB SSD.

This one laptop says 1TB SATA
11/08/2020, 10:12 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Sata is ssd?
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: Gaming laptops are not worth the money
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: Go for a PC instead
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 88798 05171: No
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 77180 82108: SATA is an interface
11/08/2020, 10:14 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Alright thanks

11/08/2020, 10:23 pm - Tushar Nankani: If portability won't be an issue, then definitely go ahead with PC.
11/08/2020, 10:26 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Okay guys. Thanks
11/08/2020, 10:30 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True

We won't rush, we attack each topic one by one, week by week, we will keep solving and keep answering till we all get it right. This is the boost you ever needed to kick-start your DSA journey!

13/08/2020, 11:51 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Guys, 
Suppose I have a US based server hosting my website. Now I wanna get a storage service for my website (Amazon S3)
Would it be better if I get a US based storage or an indian one?
13/08/2020, 11:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not enough details.
13/08/2020, 11:54 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): What do you need?
13/08/2020, 11:57 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Details.
13/08/2020, 12:00 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Lmao
13/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Elaborate on what details you need Kartikkkk
13/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂
13/08/2020, 12:02 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): What details?😂

Alright, so it's a django based website
So I need the storage to upload images from the admin panel and display it to the users 
So I was thinking whether it'll be better if I had an indian based storage since the users are from india
13/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *THESE* details.
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So why is the website hosted in the US?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Won't the AWS CDN handle that?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Django 🤩
My heart goes 
La La La La La
La La La La
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): 😂
13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A cdn is a Content *Delivery* Network.
13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah, but it can cache stuff, so it won't have to keep fetching stuff from the US, right?
13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 🤦‍♂️
13/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂🤣
13/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): By  the way
I'm having an amazing time playing with serializers & Sending JSON responses.
13/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Great!
13/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So happy,
I don't have to think where ye color accha hai 
Or fixing padding issues...
13/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Same here🤟🤟
13/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Clients are irritating😭
13/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I literally changed theme 3 time in one of my app... hopefully I never used colour directly😅
13/08/2020, 12:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 12:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): CoMpUtEr GrApHiCs
13/08/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 82916 21138: 🤣
13/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 75078 05454: 😂 it's difficult to make that library work with gcc. You have to get a ported version and then link the library while compiling. Even then the things that can be drawn with that library make you feel like you have time travelled to 2009 😂
13/08/2020, 2:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I really dk why such stuff is being taught to us, instead theu could teach Graphics in Python/Java
13/08/2020, 2:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): C/C++ is used for system programming
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know how Graphics are drawn in Python/Java?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It ultimately falls back to C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Would like to 😛
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): By converting in C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hai na?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But thats dead imo
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why would we do that work? libraries hai na Java/Python mai
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Nah bro
Even paint and all built using C/C++
I heard
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): How do you think Python Was built ?
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ha but do we really have to rebuild the wheel🤔
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes bro C/C++ are base of all languages I understand
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, but you should understand how the wheel works.
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's for those who want it get into Graphics 
Suppose Game Dev me bhi
If you see the Game Engines are also built using C+++
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True but....turbo C++ use karna zaroori hai uske liye😂
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 75078 05454: we should be learning 3d graphics using opengl or something
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): C++
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That I agree with.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): C#
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But after basic graphics.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): graphics.h is obsolete right?
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We use C# while building games
But
The actual Engine 
Unity is built using C++
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 75078 05454: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3UicqQtfNuKZjdA3fY1_X9gXn13JLlW
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ooh
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 97739 65140: Same for Unreap
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 75078 05454: something like this
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh wow
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 97739 65140: *unreal
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Will search more about these
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): @918080142783 if they are doing graphics cpp and their libraries are old then how morden languages are using it?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Like are they modifying it or something else?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, graphics.h is depricated because modern processors support SIMD.
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Or calling its methods internally
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): SIMD is Single Instruction, Multiple Data.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if you want to add/multiply 4 sets of numbers then you can do it in 1 operation.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): So the languages are using this and we are learning graphics.h?🤦‍♂️
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Okk
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This effectively increases the speed by 4x.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): MU doing MU things
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 75078 05454: oh
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nice
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 75078 05454: 😂
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You don't start learning to balance on a motorcycle, right?
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Haa but I just asking this
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is easier to understand SIMD once you know what the hell you are actually doing with the data.
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ooh
13/08/2020, 2:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But sometimes you can skip bicycle😁
13/08/2020, 2:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Great,then maybe can explore further If its goof
13/08/2020, 2:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why would you do that😂
13/08/2020, 2:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, for anyone interested in game *engine* design + OpenGL:

13/08/2020, 2:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I don't know how to answer.
13/08/2020, 2:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I started with programming in 8/9th.
13/08/2020, 2:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And just went with whatever interested me at that time.
13/08/2020, 2:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): still
you have so much computer knowledge
13/08/2020, 2:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Apart from programming tooo

15/08/2020, 11:07 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Total no of students in Tsec in 1 year=
120 CS + 120 IT + 60 Extc + 60 Biomedical + 60 BioTech + 60 Chemical = 480
.°.Total number of students in all 4 years=480*4=1920(minimum no of students) 
Tution fees per sem = 129545
Consider in worst case 50% students as OBC/EBC
No of obc/ebc students=960
.°.Rem students=960
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by obc/ebc students= 960*129545*0.5 =62181600
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by regular students= 960*129545=124,363,200
Total tution fees gained per year = 186,544,800
Total college development feea gained per year = 1920*12955 = 24,873,600

Total income of college per year(worst case) = 186544800+24873600 = 211,418,400 = 21.14Cr

Now with such an amount of income considering the fees to be given to teachers,other staffs,electricity bill and cost of devices,etc..still there must be a decent amount of money left with the authority, where that goes!!!!!!

24/08/2020, 3:12 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion:

Do everything yourself, college is mostly useless.

Do DBMS and DSA yourself, they are really important.
DSA: Please code things out yourself. Try to code out all the DS and their types yourself. DSA Sorting: GFG has short vids on all sorts on YT. They are your bible.

Imp vid: SQL and ER diags: https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY

Do a small crash course on core Java. It's moderately important. Please don't go for any long course.

PCE is just mugging up.

What is comp. prog. fundas!? We didn't have that. Idr what we had in place of that lol
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): DSA should we learn only in C or other languages as well?
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion: Do everything from YT. Don't take any courses, even if they are free.
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): C for now.
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - +91 84335 18102: <Media omitted>

24/08/2020, 3:17 pm - +91 82916 40581: Could you recommend any books for DSA and DBMS ?
24/08/2020, 3:20 pm - +91 97027 35002: I honestly dont know why comp.prog.fundas exists
24/08/2020, 3:20 pm - +91 97027 35002: Its like just basics of everything all over again😂🤦🏻‍♂️
24/08/2020, 3:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its MU deal w it
24/08/2020, 3:20 pm - +91 97027 35002: Like literally the basics
24/08/2020, 3:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): thats actually great
24/08/2020, 3:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion:

DSA: PLEASE code things yourself. If you want to refer to a book, not required of you've paid attention in class, 'DS and algo in C'.

DBMS: Do the SQL vid that I shared. I would not recommend a book. Use Techmax.
24/08/2020, 3:21 pm - +91 97027 35002: Are i'm saying ki kiya hoga na sabne🤦🏻‍♂️
24/08/2020, 3:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Idea behind pcpf is good like to give students idea of how coding works not how language works but feel kinda implemented in crappy way...

24/08/2020, 3:23 pm - +91 97027 35002: Fair enough
24/08/2020, 3:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, please download, install and acutally USE a Database.
24/08/2020, 3:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MariaDB/MySQL for SQL, and MongoDB/Redis for NoSQL.
24/08/2020, 3:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Play around with the command line, and understand the difference between SQL and NoSQl.
24/08/2020, 3:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes yes
24/08/2020, 3:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, ```mariadb``` and ```mariadbd``` are VERY different.

25/08/2020, 10:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If supply increases demands decreases
25/08/2020, 10:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I literally have wasted 18 years of my life it seems sometimes😂
25/08/2020, 10:32 pm - +91 82916 21138: Still things are changing now although thanks to internet
25/08/2020, 10:32 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This will decrease the value of IITians
25/08/2020, 10:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): demand increases when padosi ka beta scores more marks than you
25/08/2020, 10:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yahi hota hai bad

25/08/2020, 10:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ive seen many ppl forced into engineering
25/08/2020, 10:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): lol
25/08/2020, 10:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Truee
25/08/2020, 10:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I just took jee bcoz I was enthusiastic abt science tbh
25/08/2020, 10:35 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): 💯
25/08/2020, 10:36 pm - +91 82916 21138: True agree with this
25/08/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 82916 21138: True same here still new things about some nano technology or something grabs my eyes
25/08/2020, 10:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): lol JEE mai nothing was like that,all sum solving
25/08/2020, 10:37 pm - +91 82916 21138: True like I have seen people just taking enginerring as backup because they want job .
25/08/2020, 10:38 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Last slide 🔥
25/08/2020, 10:38 pm - +91 82916 21138: True issliye I hate that now and sum solving was only on some concepts we never saw why are we doing this or why are we learning this what's its use nothing it was like it's in portion you have to do it
25/08/2020, 10:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ab chod, ho gaya

Missed half a lec
26/08/2020, 10:10 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I slept at 1 and woke up at 5😂...we all are destroying our sleeping schedule

26/08/2020, 12:00 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F😂
26/08/2020, 12:00 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): They love obsolete stuff
26/08/2020, 12:00 pm - +91 97681 67131: Netscape 😂😂 Seriously 😂😂
26/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Netscape uses Java for webpages( or used to)
26/08/2020, 12:01 pm - +91 97681 67131: Actually university is also to blame they don’t update portion 😂😂
26/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): University toh bahi🙏
26/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): What is this 😭😂
26/08/2020, 12:02 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ab bechare java ki kya he value rehgayi hai😂
26/08/2020, 12:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Web mai nahi hai,I mean frontend
26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): JavaScript has taken over from long
26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - +91 97694 89970: Also, during pracs we have to write html in *notepad* only and not VScode 🙂
26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂😂😂😭😭
26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F
26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - +91 86559 19035: That's messed up
26/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You know, that I sort of agree with.
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918828470904  cursed?
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Actually
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bcoz tags yaad kaise honge😅
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): VSCode has too much hand-holding.
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I'm writing java in notepad++😂
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But hamesha using notepad is stupidity
26/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fir bhi ok
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I'm missing auto bracket closing😂
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I feel they should at least allow syntax hlighting, like vim or emacs or even notepad++.
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True lol
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - +91 84335 18102: true that
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Or sublime
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): text
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, not even sublime text.
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - +91 97694 89970: Hmm yes u r ryt. They gave the same reason that in exam we have to write everything so using notepad will help us to remember tags. But not everytime ya. I miss the boiler plate :/
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, too much autocomplete.
26/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Hehe
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - +91 97681 67131: Me too but I told sir ki on Mac no  good editor so he allowed VS Code 😂
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - +91 97694 89970: Whoa 👌🏼🙌🏼😂
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have TextEdit.
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Jhuta😂
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know but dint want to use..
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which is actually a half decent code editior.
26/08/2020, 12:06 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya..
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Unko kya he pata chalega
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I still prefer notepad++ for speed, so 🤷‍♂️
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ?
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - +91 97681 67131: Also syntax highlighting is good sometimes
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - +91 84335 18102: aree he asks everyone to present their screens
26/08/2020, 12:07 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ha
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I personally don't use VSCode.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Arre ki mac have edittext
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why tho
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Use vim.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Textedit
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): As I said, speed.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Speed?
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Notepad++ opens in like 300 ms.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): R u talking about command line vim?
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
26/08/2020, 12:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It's not that bad.
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: Haah I know but few teachers use Mac... still they don’t know 😂😂
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: That’s the irony
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): 😂😂 they would go in comma
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Mac is Amir log things bro
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Setup a hackintosh.
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ab yeh kya hai!?
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: I started on that only
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - +91 97681 67131: Google
26/08/2020, 12:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But that might get harder with Apple Silicone.
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya true 😂
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Bhai support hardware toh ho😂
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Windows zindabad
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: Arm architecture..
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Windows ❤️
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Virtualbox.
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Docker?
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I would better use windows😂
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Or Linux
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Hypervisor?
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: This is kinda useless until have a good specked laptop u can’t really run Xcode simulator completely I tried a lot..
26/08/2020, 12:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I am skeptical about long term feasibility.
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Noooooo 🤦‍♂️
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: So last resort hackintosh... though driver support is pathetic 😂
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have completely missed the point.
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes as Microsoft is also pushing arm now
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope I guess they might just have it I was watching WWDC 2020 Rosetta 2 seems promising
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Pushing arm is not the issue.
(Arm actually has better performance for lower price)
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: They can’t make it happen for that u need control over hardware as well
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: They failed once remember snapdragon 835 laptop
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 88284 70904: Mai sublime mai likha kuch bola nahi lol😂
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 86559 19035: And lower thermals
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 97681 67131: Windows ka some hp or Lenovo built in 2018 ig
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): They are partnering with Qualcomm for chipset and supporting them
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 86559 19035: Doesn't mean always
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): +1
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The only reason big companies (Adobe/Autodesk) write hight performance software for Macs is because it is 99% similiar to Windows.
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the extra effort is justified.
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (And almost negligible)
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): After foldable from Microsoft i think they will do it
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know I read that now issue is they are different companies after all so how things work out is interesting also interesting is to see what amd and intel have in stock...
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But if Windows and Mac instruction sets diverge, then most software will either stop supporting mac, or will use the automatice translation tools and take a huge performance hit.
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 86559 19035: Amd is beating intel with ryzen for now in most places at lower costs
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes because intel n amd will suffer the most
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 97681 67131: True agreed but I know if someone in the industry can make such big changes though foolish and work for them in their favour it’s got to be Apple...
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not every time.
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True but will developer take enough efforts?
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 86559 19035: They have given transition period for now and pro stuff stays on intel for now
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 86559 19035: So we have to see what happens
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Adobe does NOT support the latest Mac Pro or the ludicrously expensive "Pro display".
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya that’s the catch Mac app support in App Store isn’t gr8 anyway, with arm chips Apple can bring mobile developers as in iPad OS and iOS developers to develop as well
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but that will be throwing away like 35+ YEARS of desktop developers.
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Imagine the knowledge and experience.
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes 😂😂
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 86559 19035: Not exactly
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: I agree but I feel they can pull this one off...
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - +91 97681 67131: Plus they aren’t throwing anything to trash Rosetta 2 is helping not arm optimised apps to run at least
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Do u know how irritating it is to develop a UI for different screen size🥺
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Forget UI, do you know how irritating it is to optimize for a different INSTRUCTION SET?
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ig they will Microsoft already had office ready on WWDC 2020 announced day to run on Mac so... Also it’s Apple a trillion dollar market cap company they can make it happen...
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Never did that😂😅
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): It will take a loooonng time
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even today, most server software has two versions: Windows (semi-supported) and Linux.
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - +91 97681 67131: That’s the catch, since Apple has selected number of products which often use same screen sizes say like se 2020 which is iPhone 6 ka screen only so it’s much easier for them...
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MariaDB straight up has this warning: If you compile this on Mac, then anything that happens is your problem.
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: They themselves mention 2 yrs transition time.. let’s see 😂😂
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya Agreed
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Who will install mac for server😂
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, they mean even for development.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ohh
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 97681 67131: Let’s see what pans out for the future of intel and amd specially cause that’s most interesting to me if this plan succeeds.... They won’t go without a fight it’s sure...
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh they are not going anywhere.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): one question:
why are most servers linux based?
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Apple n Epic😂😂
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even if all consumer products switch to arm, legacy servers will still need maintainence.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918080142783
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): I think Epic will win
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And don't forget mainframes.
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know but they might have to market their product differently or themselves make arm chips if Apple and Microsoft can pull arm transition off
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Open source so lot of libraries available
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Natively
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Two reasons:
- No licensing issues
- Raw performance.
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya also performance...
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And the performance part comes from being open source.
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if you don't want a network driver (for whatever reason), simply delete the code for networking and suddenly you have the best performing kernal for your application.

Today I got caught into a situation 😅😅😅
26/08/2020, 5:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Sort of...
26/08/2020, 5:03 pm - +91 98337 47258: She's one of the best teachers actually
She can be a little strict, especially in physical lecs but ya she's good
26/08/2020, 5:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Thanks
I too felt she's the best.
26/08/2020, 5:04 pm - +91 98337 47258: She's been very fast in online lecs but in physical lecs you wouldn't wanna miss her lecs
26/08/2020, 5:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Someone else was saying some dialogue 😅😂
And I ended up speaking something at the same time
And maam ko laga maine bola 😅
26/08/2020, 5:04 pm - +91 98337 47258: Dw, she's chill
26/08/2020, 5:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So now I'm her target 😅😂
26/08/2020, 5:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Alright thanks.

26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 98337 47258: And if you see SSS ma'am, just hide your face and run away
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Who is SSS?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > Anagha maam

What do you mean by best teacher?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In all her lectures, all she has done is read from the ppt.
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 98337 47258: We had her in SE too
But sem 4, i don't remember if sem 3
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ??
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like literally read out the slide line by line.
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Reminds me of Primary school teachers 😅
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 98337 47258: Just a teacher most of the students avoid
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 98337 47258: And still do ig
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And she also gave use some gems like:
"When you switch on the voltage of the current ..."
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): She forced some ppl to switch their web cams on
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): That was boss moment 😂
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 98337 47258: Yaa
She did here too
But she mentioned it was all new for her and it would make her comfortable seeing faces
So that's understandable
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, electron energy gets converted to visual energy.
26/08/2020, 5:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah thats cool actually
26/08/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 98337 47258: We have her too but I just log in and move away

26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 98337 47258: Yaa
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Umm, not really
She won't have a civil discussion
Her physical lecs seemed horrible
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Her most of the lecs just used to be mass bunks
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: She just used to read out
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Really? I have had a LOT of discussions with her.
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No. Are you sure this is the same teacher?
26/08/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 98337 47258: Ya
Had a much different experience here
26/08/2020, 5:19 pm - +91 98337 47258: Maybe lockdown changed her 😂
26/08/2020, 5:20 pm - +91 98337 47258: Even Manisha ma'am, used to be a little scared of her but during lockdowns and throughout the assignments, she seemed one of the sweetest teachers
26/08/2020, 5:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 🤷‍♂️

What sort of knowledge would this person have?
27/08/2020, 6:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I cannot say without knowing what program he ran.
27/08/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But a VERY big red flag for almost anything related to computers is when the same input gives you different outputs.
27/08/2020, 6:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if running the same program twice with the same input gives different answers then something has gone horribly wrong.
27/08/2020, 6:28 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): The entire reason chaos theory came into being is that a computer gave out different outputs. Read a little about it. It's a different case but an interesting read
27/08/2020, 6:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Got it

03/09/2020, 12:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Scanner input nahi le raha?
03/09/2020, 12:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): sc.nextLine() ka output empty hai?
03/09/2020, 12:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Objective:
- create class Employee
- implement array of type Employee
- store all data in array
03/09/2020, 12:36 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ye line string ke pehele daal
03/09/2020, 12:36 pm - +91 97027 35002: String input*
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohh pehle dalna hota hai
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 97027 35002: Its going in buffer
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 97027 35002: Enter key
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes exactly I was trying to avoid that
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 97027 35002: To first take string input
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): isliye ek empty nextLine() da;a
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 97027 35002: Then baki sab
03/09/2020, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): dala
03/09/2020, 12:38 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ya fir avoid nextLine()
03/09/2020, 12:38 pm - +91 97027 35002: Aese name middle name surname 3 inputs😂😂
03/09/2020, 12:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Change
```String name = s.nextLine();
s.nextLine();```
to
```s.nextLine();
String name = s.nextLine();```
03/09/2020, 12:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Alright
thanks
03/09/2020, 12:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And I understood also what wrong I did 
Lol
03/09/2020, 12:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): so petty mannn
03/09/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Good.
03/09/2020, 12:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Works like a charm!
Thanks
03/09/2020, 12:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because I have repeated this explaintaion 5 times.
03/09/2020, 12:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
03/09/2020, 12:47 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ah this
03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Dummy string right?
03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): .
03/09/2020, 12:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's to clear the channel.
The previous input ka enter is still in the channel
And if I don't give
s.nextLine();
 Before the string input 
Vo enter gets stored in the string ka variable 

So isliye 
To avoid that.
03/09/2020, 12:51 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 😤
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 97027 35002: Just remember to this whenever you take a interger etc input before taking string input
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 97027 35002: Integer*
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, no.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There's another workaround to this too 
Which is buffer flush or something 
But I am lazy so nextLine():
Se kar leta hai
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK listen.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ok sir.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ab khatam😂
03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - +91 97027 35002: Idt java me there is something like flushall()
03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Scanner operates on a token stream, as opposed to BufferedReader, which operates on lines.
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So, imagine Scanner gets the inputs:
```10\nHello, World!\n```
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Didn't see the code
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes ik
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, it is important to understand what the ```nextInt()``` method actually does.
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 97027 35002: Explain sir
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace.
03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\d+/```
03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning + or -, followed by one or more digits.
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okay
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So Scanner reads the token stream, finds 10 and returns it.
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now the stream is: ```\nHello, World!\n```
03/09/2020, 12:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does.
03/09/2020, 12:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer.
03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\n```).
03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (without the newline)
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\nHello, World!\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline.
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So basically 
It returned nothing in my case
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which means it will return an empty string.
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Alright. 
Got it.
Thank you.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ohhhhh
03/09/2020, 1:03 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okayyy
03/09/2020, 1:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ik this
03/09/2020, 1:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Too much damn
03/09/2020, 1:10 pm - +91 97027 35002: C me this had a function idk java me kyu nahi dala...
03/09/2020, 1:10 pm - +91 98191 73361: Flushall na?
03/09/2020, 1:11 pm - +91 97027 35002: Yes
03/09/2020, 1:14 pm - +91 73036 41107: <Media omitted>

03/09/2020, 3:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): We have to make our own,but still I think C++ should have been in portion instead of C ,I mean interview wale log want DSA in C++/Java right?

03/09/2020, 3:09 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I use this analogy:
Class is an empty admission from.
And 
Objects are the copies of that same form with details filled in.

Collaboration of 2 committees really helps an event grow bigger, ACM sets up the events, E-Cell and it's connections help with perks and opportunities like paid internships. I wonder if we could do something like this in our college?

So we have a pre recorded video just so that you can set up your systems for Flutter Development. 

Here's the video:
https://bit.ly/flutter_installation

Go through it
And follow it.
If you face any issues while installation, hit me up,
I'll help you out!
11/09/2020, 9:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Cool will
11/09/2020, 10:35 am - Tushar Nankani: Hi everyone! 

Just a request to all of you, if you see your classmates, your friends, or even acquaintances, coming up with content/ideas/YouTube videos/Instagram influencer, it's very new for them, and if you find even one thing good/creative/informative/entertained:

_Never hesitate and go ahead and message and appreciate them!_  

(Ego might be a problem here sometimes, but it won't help anyone except the ego itself XD)

It would mean so much to them, you have no idea! 

It would really, really boost their confidence, by your words! 🙌🏻

11/09/2020, 10:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes 
I'll tell you what
I have this one principle:
If you are interested in something, learn it
If you are not interested in something, learn only so much 
That someone else can't rip you off.

Like you must be smart enough to understand whether something is good/bad for you

Also must seek guidance of that person who knows about it and you trust them.

12/09/2020, 9:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Run kar 
But can you explain the error?
12/09/2020, 9:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Perspective nhi compiler hai
12/09/2020, 9:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): at least kya wrong hai woh pata chala
12/09/2020, 9:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You understood what is wrong?
12/09/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 97027 35002: Haa par kyu wo nahi😂
12/09/2020, 9:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Issa Compile Time Error
12/09/2020, 9:11 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): @918451904417 error bata de
12/09/2020, 9:11 pm - +91 97694 89970: I can. That's interesting question ;)

12/09/2020, 9:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ha ive faced this issue
12/09/2020, 9:12 pm - +91 97694 89970: x variable ki value initialise nahi ki. 
It is a local var and for local variables compulsory initialisation karna padta hai. JVM default value provide nai karega
12/09/2020, 9:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): durin codeforces ke rounds
12/09/2020, 9:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): dek liya haan
12/09/2020, 9:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): right
12/09/2020, 9:12 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 👍
12/09/2020, 9:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes
12/09/2020, 9:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): But if mein kiya na?
12/09/2020, 9:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nai nai wont suffice

12/09/2020, 9:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I had run into this issue during codeforces ka koi mashup,I was like wtf is wrong with buej
12/09/2020, 9:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Kyu bhai compiler ko kya natak hai?
12/09/2020, 9:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): bluej
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It will fucking work for all languages
But not Java

Java, while compiling check what if all the cases fail?

I am NEVER going to give a garbage error like C or C++
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): they have to fix thus lmao
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Garbage Value**
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 99693 94098: The compiler doesn't know if the condition will be satisfied till it executes it. So it just assumes that it will not enter if at all
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): garbage values in C/C++
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 97681 67131: Is it cause by Default java mai variables aren't initialized??
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): .
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): right,it just checks the syntax
12/09/2020, 9:15 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Haa ekdum sahi yehi sunna tha😂
12/09/2020, 9:15 pm - +91 97681 67131: agar static declare karega @918451904417 toh run hota hai??
12/09/2020, 9:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): bhai,ek dum se @918451904417  ne vakt badal diye jasbaat badal di......
12/09/2020, 9:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Interestingly

If suppose go 2 class method

and try to access it using an object
It will work
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - +91 97694 89970: If main method ke andar hai na. It's declared inside method so still it is a local variable
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Because of Natkhat Default constructor
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yess 😂
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, are you initializing it?
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah that is  the saviour
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): local variables static!?
12/09/2020, 9:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nahi kar skte ig
12/09/2020, 9:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I call it a 
Pessimistic compiler
Always thinking about failures😂😂😂
12/09/2020, 9:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): its preparing for the worst
12/09/2020, 9:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): thats good
12/09/2020, 9:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): lol
12/09/2020, 9:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: Static variable by default initialised to zero
12/09/2020, 9:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): local bro
12/09/2020, 9:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @919768167131
12/09/2020, 9:18 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes sir
Does not want to give garbage value to its master
12/09/2020, 9:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: Oh ha it’s declared in class 😂
12/09/2020, 9:19 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yes we can't declare in method 🤷🏻‍♂️
12/09/2020, 9:19 pm - +91 99693 94098: Considering our stupid semicolon mistakes I think it's better if it stays that way 😂
12/09/2020, 9:19 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): time to switch to some other langauage
12/09/2020, 9:19 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yess sir!!!!!
12/09/2020, 9:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): As I say
The more I do Java
More I like it!😂
12/09/2020, 9:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Java
Mission failed:
12/09/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 97681 67131: @919820696178 start switching then 😂
12/09/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 97681 67131: And @918451904417 you are going the opposite way 😂😂
12/09/2020, 9:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919768167131 
You know Swift right?
12/09/2020, 9:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂😂
12/09/2020, 9:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Python time
12/09/2020, 9:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Java is the guy who plays it safe
12/09/2020, 9:21 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes!
12/09/2020, 9:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): maybe thats why I always like it
12/09/2020, 9:21 pm - +91 97694 89970: Can feel you! :)
12/09/2020, 9:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): C/C++ mai those huge values are annoying
12/09/2020, 9:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): garbage
12/09/2020, 9:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes little but Apple is very nutorios in changing stntax between version but good thing is they give free conversion to newest version just by one click 😂 which I love all by swift 4 projects I ported to swift 5 with this only
12/09/2020, 9:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: True

12/09/2020, 10:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This should not compile.
12/09/2020, 10:19 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): how?
12/09/2020, 10:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): by the way C/C++ are very unforgiving
12/09/2020, 10:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): in terms of errors
12/09/2020, 10:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Java doesn't risk condition evaluation.

12/09/2020, 10:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I was using codeblocks
12/09/2020, 10:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): C is horrible with errors.
12/09/2020, 10:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): not any fancy editor
12/09/2020, 10:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Still.
12/09/2020, 10:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): and I hate C++ idk why
12/09/2020, 10:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): will have to take another shot
12/09/2020, 10:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, this happened to me personally.

12/09/2020, 10:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Hands down the BEST IDE.
12/09/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): true
12/09/2020, 10:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): NOT VSCode.

12/09/2020, 10:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes that’s toh obvious but I don’t know since I like Python and android studio since start I prefer jet brains ke koi bhi IDE
12/09/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): itna bhi noob nahi hu
12/09/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂😂

12/09/2020, 10:27 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes I know but on Mac, it installs  all Xamrin dependencies so goes like above 20gbs better I give Xcode that much 😂
12/09/2020, 10:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Best IDEs (according to me)

C/C++ - Visual Studio
Java - IntelliJ
Python - no IDE can improve Python.
JavaScript - VSCode or Brackets
12/09/2020, 10:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂😂
12/09/2020, 10:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): python
12/09/2020, 10:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): python ke liye Pycharm good enough
12/09/2020, 10:29 pm - +91 97681 67131: PyCharm does the trick also spyder if you use anaconda

12/09/2020, 10:59 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): A great book to start! (It might seem boring, but still try finishing it)

PS: Haven't read it entirely yet the author of this book was Warren Buffett's mentor and anyone would definitely suggest you to start with it
12/09/2020, 11:07 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ty🙏
12/09/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 91525 25452: You guys can also check these out:

13/09/2020, 4:33 am - +91 97694 89970: For all the Java Enthus out there,



public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
     
      byte b = 127;
      b += 3;

      System.out.println(b);
    }
}



This looks like really very easy but it blew my mind when I got to know what is happening actually behind the scenes. 
This one is really interesting ;)
Do give it a try, solve it with pen and paper and don't just directly execute 🤦🏻‍♂️

Hint- You will crack this if you have good understanding of how things will work at memory level and stuff :)
13/09/2020, 4:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): By any chance, have you read this book:
How to steal like an artist?
😂
13/09/2020, 4:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll definitely give it a try
13/09/2020, 4:34 am - +91 97694 89970: Maybe many of u'll would give correct ans but it's just that I found basic things like this interesting and was new for me during my learning process :)
13/09/2020, 4:35 am - +91 97694 89970: Amm... Naah why? 😅😂
13/09/2020, 4:35 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Kuch nhi chhod 😂

13/09/2020, 4:36 am - +91 97694 89970: byte data type 🤷🏻‍♂️
I knw rarely anyone uses it but it exists 😂
13/09/2020, 4:37 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh
Pehlii  baar suna

13/09/2020, 4:38 am - +91 97694 89970: Yes plz
13/09/2020, 4:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I just googled byte data type
13/09/2020, 4:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I get to know 
Iska range is from
-128 to 127
13/09/2020, 4:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You already got 127 in b
13/09/2020, 4:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you are adding 3
It would not give 130
Because range hi nahi hai
13/09/2020, 4:45 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But kya output aayega lemme try to figure out
13/09/2020, 4:45 am - +91 97694 89970: Yes ;)
13/09/2020, 9:14 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): -125?
13/09/2020, 9:20 am - Tushar Nankani: -126
13/09/2020, 9:51 am - +91 97694 89970: Yesss right 👌🏼👍🏼
13/09/2020, 10:21 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ok mera maths ka issue hai 😂
13/09/2020, 10:42 am - +91 97694 89970: Ohh koi nai u were so close though 👏🏼😉
13/09/2020, 10:42 am - +91 97739 65140: Aise aur chahiye kya
Mere paas bohit padhe hai
Mad club mein Maine Apne mentees ko isse bohot tang kiya tha😂
13/09/2020, 10:45 am - +91 97694 89970: Hahaha yess 🙏🏼😅😂
Pareshaan toh karte hai kuch questions but bohat kuch sikha jaate hai.
13/09/2020, 10:48 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): +1
13/09/2020, 10:53 am - +91 97739 65140: Ok, Try guessing the o/p of this 
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    byte x=2;
        byte y=4;
        byte z=x+y;
        System.out.println(z);

	}
}
13/09/2020, 10:54 am - +91 97739 65140: without running the code of course
13/09/2020, 10:55 am - +91 97694 89970: Error aayega. Inconvertible types: Possible Loss of Precision from Int to Byte
13/09/2020, 10:55 am - +91 97694 89970: Ryt?
13/09/2020, 10:55 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes😂 My god, pros are here
13/09/2020, 10:55 am - +91 97694 89970: No ha. Nothing like that 🙏🏼😅

13/09/2020, 11:05 am - +91 97739 65140: Try guessing output of this without running the code:
not many people know about this and precedence in my opinion works very weirdly here😅

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    boolean a=false,b=false,c=false,x=false;
        x = (a = true) || (b = true) && (c = true);
        System.out.print (a + "," + b + ", " + c);
	}
}
13/09/2020, 11:06 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True, true,true?
13/09/2020, 11:06 am - +91 97739 65140: no
13/09/2020, 11:06 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ab konsa error?😂
13/09/2020, 11:07 am - +91 97739 65140: Sorry, kripya Thoda vyale punha ekda tapusan paha😂😂
13/09/2020, 11:07 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): 😂
13/09/2020, 11:11 am - +91 97739 65140: Take your time guys. This is really difficult and quite a twist in its own imo
13/09/2020, 11:14 am - +91 97739 65140: And let me know if you guys want a hint??
13/09/2020, 11:15 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Precedence of the && is more than || right?
13/09/2020, 11:15 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Do bhai
13/09/2020, 11:15 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:16 am - Tushar Nankani: My mind is saying, error dega, because shouldn't it be == instead of =

And now that you mentioned precedence, ```and``` has higher precedence than ```or```. But you have mentioned that explicitly, so I am confused 😂
13/09/2020, 11:16 am - +91 97739 65140: This message was deleted
13/09/2020, 11:16 am - +91 91725 67828: True, false, false?
13/09/2020, 11:16 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Cpp mein = chalta hai ig
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - +91 97739 65140: Simple hint is think about precedence and prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes, but why??
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Got it
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wait
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Pehle a = True hua
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That executes
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Theek hai
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 97739 65140: no, it doesn't give error. This is valid in java, only if you put it in if then will it give an error
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then we have or
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Any thing or with true is true
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So 
Baki 2 exp don't get executed
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 91725 67828: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 97739 65140: yes, but kya bhai??
Ideally nhi shona chahiye
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - +91 97739 65140: *hona
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Brackets phele hona chaiye right?
Saare
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ideally
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - +91 97739 65140: this is what is happening but think in terms of precedence, this should not happen
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes got you
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - Tushar Nankani: boolean a=false,b=false,c=false,x=false;
        x = ((a = true) || (b = true) && (c = true));
        System.out.print (a + "," + b + ", " + c);
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - Tushar Nankani: What about this?
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - +91 97739 65140: still it should give true, false, false
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - +91 97739 65140: If you want to understand the logic, think in terms of prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919773965140 
Aisi cheeze bhej te raho
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Massssst hai
13/09/2020, 11:23 am - +91 97739 65140: 😂
13/09/2020, 11:24 am - +91 97739 65140: If anyone of you don't get it, then I will explain
13/09/2020, 11:24 am - +91 97739 65140: what's happening here
13/09/2020, 11:25 am - +91 88284 70904: I understood the false false scenario coz it’s happening due to precedence
13/09/2020, 11:26 am - +91 88284 70904: But the first true ka m not getting
13/09/2020, 11:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): -126?
13/09/2020, 11:27 am - +91 97694 89970: Yes correct :)
13/09/2020, 11:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn how?
13/09/2020, 11:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean System.out.println() is an overloaded method
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It supports all data types if Im not wrong😅
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - +91 97739 65140: x+y is an int
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - +91 97739 65140: Not byte
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Accha waise
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh F ha
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Shitt😂
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I've never used byte till now😂
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - +91 97739 65140: Wait till you see the magic of Strings in Java😂
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, I still don't get how?
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ?
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Strings sab language ka ajeeb he lagta hai😅
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Strings in Java are cool
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - +91 97739 65140: 😂😂😂
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nah C/C++ ke sabse ajeb hai
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - +91 97739 65140: smallest storage register size is integer not byte
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - +91 97739 65140: So, anything smaller than int if you operate them it will always result in int
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay  
But you declared them as byte ba?
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Na*
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: .
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: This rule holds
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97694 89970: If we apply any arithmetic operator between two variables a and b, then the result type is always *max(int , type of a, type of b)*
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh okay
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: 👍🏻🔥🔥
13/09/2020, 11:33 am - +91 97739 65140: Bro, in this if you know how expressions are executed
You will know we make prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:33 am - +91 82916 21138: True,false ,false cause left to right Jayega I guess
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ✅
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This ik
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - +91 82916 21138: I had seen this question in my tenth prelims 😂
13/09/2020, 11:36 am - +91 97694 89970: c ka false kaise aaya?
I'm getting true false true 🤦🏻‍♂️
13/09/2020, 11:36 am - +91 97739 65140: In this case prefix expression is :

||=aTrue&&=bTrue=cTrue


So, here || will operate on =aTrue first as if that is true then it need not go to right
13/09/2020, 11:37 am - +91 97739 65140: Bro, in simple words || is a short circuiting operator
13/09/2020, 11:37 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yess
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is short circuit operators ka magic
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - +91 97739 65140: So, if you have a||b,
If a is true, it doesn't operate b
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 🙏🙏
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - +91 97739 65140: *execute b
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn Ive forgotten the basics
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Aur bhejo aise😂
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Damn, your school op
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Sure
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 88284 70904: Bhai kya!!!????😂
13/09/2020, 11:40 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn our school set really dirty questions but is level tak nahi gaye hai
13/09/2020, 11:40 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
13/09/2020, 11:41 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍
13/09/2020, 11:41 am - +91 97694 89970: Haa yeh barabar... Uske baad a= true aur b=false rahega. And then c ka?
&& ke pehle wala expression true hai par abhi aage bhi we have to check na?
13/09/2020, 11:42 am - +91 97739 65140: bro
13/09/2020, 11:43 am - +91 97739 65140: check this
13/09/2020, 11:43 am - +91 97739 65140: since || is the first operation here , it will short circuit . Had there been any other operation , it would have worked differently
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 97694 89970: Areyyy. Haa got it got it 🙈
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ye abhi bhi nhi smajha
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 97739 65140: bro this is how computer evaluates your expressions
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97739 65140: sem 3 mein padhate hai in application of stacks
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97694 89970: Ahh. See yahi hua 😌😂
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): To swap two variables without a third one,this works in Java ig:
b= a+b - (a=b)
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97739 65140: prefix and postfix notation
13/09/2020, 11:46 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Abhi chal rha hai yeh
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Even the concept is very interesting
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Mujhe ghanta kuch samja nahi ye
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919773965140 
How do I even attempt this 😂
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - +91 97739 65140: bro, wait
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - +91 97739 65140: I am still on this
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okok
13/09/2020, 11:49 am - +91 97739 65140: I guess this should work , but only if it is int, float, double.
You can't do this for others
13/09/2020, 11:49 am - +91 98206 14506: Woah cool!
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - +91 91725 67828: x = (a = true) || *(*(b = true) && (c = true) *)*;
      
Precedence ki wajese you'll get these extra brackets,
But the associativity is still left to right, so a=true will remain the same
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - +91 82916 21138: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/09/2020, 11:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes it does
13/09/2020, 11:52 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): My mind can't even process this shit😂
13/09/2020, 11:52 am - +91 97694 89970: Woah 👌🏼🔥
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 82916 21138: Yeah this was in 10th too right tanay ?
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But the most efficient way is using ex-or
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 97739 65140: kya op hai
s=%r;print(s%%s) 
??
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nope lol,not for me
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 82916 21138: Arrey 🤣 so mere school be muje Bohot mara phir toh 😡🤢
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 82916 21138: One more trick question which java developers gets confused doing c is the increment and decrement
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 82916 21138: Cause in java we go left to right but in c it's anything 😂
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 97739 65140: very true
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Happy that Java was my first
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 🙏🙏
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The output is the exact same expression
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Same to same.
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - +91 82916 21138: I had a fight with my professor last sem on a increment and decrement 😂 while c programming lectures
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Major F
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 82916 21138: Since I was from java background she started telling me you are wrong etc etc and it turned out both were right 😂
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 97739 65140: abbey yaar this is python 2 ka format syntax
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Quines bolte hai inhe apparently
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Self replicating code
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - +91 97739 65140: so , you have something like print('hi %s bye'%('Dheeraj'))
This is python 2 formatting
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Idk about %r
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - +91 97739 65140: so here he did print(s%s)
13/09/2020, 11:58 am - +91 97739 65140: who confusion karne ke liye hai apparently 😂😂🤣
13/09/2020, 11:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F
13/09/2020, 11:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): %r and %s is same right?
13/09/2020, 11:58 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ok samja
13/09/2020, 12:00 pm - +91 97739 65140: don't know, tbh , I saw %r for the first time in my life😂😂

13/09/2020, 12:19 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This is lit af
13/09/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is HEAVILY used for data processing.
13/09/2020, 12:50 pm - +91 97694 89970: Ohh yess true. Byte is the best choice if we want to handle data in terms of strings either from the file or from the network. 
I saw the usage of it in Serialization concept.
13/09/2020, 1:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Another good question,predict the O/p:
(alert:you need to know a bit of pre-defined non-primitive data types for this and some OOP)

public class Demo{ 
    public static void main(String[] arr){ 
        Integer num1 = 100; 
        Integer num2 = 100; 
        Integer num3 = 500; 
        Integer num4 = 500; 
          
        if(num1==num2){ 
            System.out.println("num1 == num2"); 
        } 
        else{ 
            System.out.println("num1 != num2"); 
        } 
        if(num3 == num4){ 
            System.out.println("num3 == num4"); 
        } 
        else{ 
            System.out.println("num3 != num4"); 
        } 
    } 
}
13/09/2020, 1:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh wrapper functions?
13/09/2020, 1:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Niceee
13/09/2020, 1:52 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nope havent used wrapper fns here
13/09/2020, 1:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I mean Wrapper classes

b) num1 == num2
    num3 != num4
c) num1 != num2
    num3 == num4
d) num1 != num2
    num3 != num4
13/09/2020, 1:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So 
num1 != num2
num3 != num4
13/09/2020, 1:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nope
13/09/2020, 1:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay
13/09/2020, 1:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): made it more easy ,cmon everyone have a go at this
13/09/2020, 1:56 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I need to read more about Integer type
13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah but...one hiny
13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I know 1 thing
that 
All these nums are objects
13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): close enough but one concpet threw you off
13/09/2020, 1:57 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): concept*
13/09/2020, 2:00 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I don't know the concept
13/09/2020, 2:00 pm - +91 82916 21138: A
13/09/2020, 2:00 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok nvm,let others try
13/09/2020, 2:00 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): nope
13/09/2020, 2:00 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nope
13/09/2020, 2:00 pm - +91 82916 21138: ? Why ?
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ruk ja let sufficient ppl try,if you want I will dm it to you
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 82916 21138: We can compare objects right .?
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 82916 21138: DM Kar
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes but....
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Chal
It is related to range onlt na?
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa Nahi bolunga
13/09/2020, 2:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): closer
13/09/2020, 2:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): range is like byte

-128 to 127
13/09/2020, 2:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes
13/09/2020, 2:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): for some important thing
13/09/2020, 2:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @919769489970  @919773965140  do try this one!
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): B?
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 👍
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): but why?
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ill tell you
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): woh bata😂
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Unka loc alag hota hai
13/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I think so
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): 😂😂
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Mein ese he feka tha
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you want to compare objects
equals() use karna chaiye
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not ==
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Haa a reason
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): here is the answer:

Answer: b)num1 == num2
                  num3 != num4
Reason: We always thought that whenever two object references are compared using “==”, it always evaluates to “false”. But here Integer caching changes the results.Integer class has a caching range of -128 to 127. Whenever a number is between this range and autoboxing is used, it assigns the same reference. That’s why for value 100, both num1 and num2 will have the same reference, but for the value 500 (not in the range of -128 to 127), num3 and num4 will have different reference.
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I knew this for String
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String ke liye always same location hota hai
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String pool ki vjh se
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): yesssss
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Mereko laga ki jo issue hota hai bade numbers mein hota hai issleye smaller number would be true😂
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): if you want different String then use String Builder/Buffer
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂😂
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂👍
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Correct
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This is something new I learnt
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yessss right mahn. I was trying to recollect auto boxing and unboxing.
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah,I always used to take it for granted
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Unbox Therapy😂.
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ki Integer = int
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ye sem mein sab java pro hai next sem mein sab python pro honge😂
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 😂😂
13/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 😂
13/09/2020, 2:16 pm - +91 97694 89970: 😅😂
13/09/2020, 3:28 pm - +91 83292 66084: Overflow hojaega it will go to negative side.
13/09/2020, 3:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes
Samja
13/09/2020, 3:28 pm - +91 83292 66084: Yup
13/09/2020, 3:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919769489970 
Vo byte wale me bhi yehi hota hai
13/09/2020, 3:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Overflow hoke negative side pe gaya
13/09/2020, 3:39 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yes bro. Byte se Int ho jaataa hai woh, phir bcoz of compound assignment operator downcasting or narrowing JVM automatically karta hai jiske karan memory loss hota hai and we get 130 ka in byte as  -126. 

But there's a small catch here, agar b = b + 3 likha hota toh humko error milta tha ;)
13/09/2020, 3:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes!
13/09/2020, 3:47 pm - +91 97739 65140: num1==num2
num3!=num4
13/09/2020, 3:47 pm - +91 97739 65140: ??
13/09/2020, 3:47 pm - +91 97739 65140: Am I correct?
13/09/2020, 3:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
13/09/2020, 3:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 🔥👍
13/09/2020, 3:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): How did you even remember🙈🙈
13/09/2020, 3:48 pm - +91 97739 65140: On the same point, should I give a question
13/09/2020, 3:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes...
13/09/2020, 3:49 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yes
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yessssssssss
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - +91 97739 65140: Because I know Java Strings
And I have done a lot of ungli with integers in python
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - +91 97739 65140: Same concept is applied there too
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh lol
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I have not messed much with Python but Java yes
13/09/2020, 3:51 pm - +91 97739 65140: Try this:
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    String a = "Hello";
	    String b = "Hello";
	    String c = new String("Hi");
	    String d = new String("Hi");
	    System.out.println(a==b);
	    System.out.println(c==d);
	}
}
13/09/2020, 3:52 pm - +91 97739 65140: Here, you need to know a little more about strings to crack this
13/09/2020, 3:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): True
False
13/09/2020, 3:52 pm - +91 97739 65140: Nice!

False
True
13/09/2020, 4:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bcoz string is not null
13/09/2020, 4:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And equals method is not like ==
13/09/2020, 4:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): equals () compares content
== compares the reference
13/09/2020, 4:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Right?
13/09/2020, 4:33 pm - +91 97694 89970: Agar null consider karte toh bhi false false true hi aata
13/09/2020, 4:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Wait
13/09/2020, 4:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Accha toh anything except true dala toh false?
13/09/2020, 4:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True false
13/09/2020, 4:35 pm - +91 97694 89970: Acha u tell me agar "yes" and "no" ke badle, "True" and "true" daalte toh kya aata o/p

13/09/2020, 5:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): so maybe
13/09/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 97739 65140: do you know tuples?
13/09/2020, 5:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes....not too well
13/09/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 97739 65140: one way to create them is x = 1,2,3
13/09/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 97739 65140: print(x)
(1,2,3)
13/09/2020, 5:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): oh ,python 2?
13/09/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 97739 65140: No, python3 don't know if it works in python 2 though
13/09/2020, 5:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Idk this,im a beginner in Python
13/09/2020, 5:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): okk
13/09/2020, 5:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ty
13/09/2020, 5:19 pm - +91 97739 65140: So, in this case, it is a tuple, with last value being True ==(True,True,False)
13/09/2020, 5:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah got it
13/09/2020, 5:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Tuples are immutable right???
13/09/2020, 5:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes
13/09/2020, 5:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Exactly
13/09/2020, 5:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That's the reason

13/09/2020, 5:34 pm - +91 97739 65140: You guys want to know what's broken in Python. it's the // operator😅😂.
Trying out following question in the right mind with a lot of patience, otherwise you might end up hating python😅.
x=5
y=3
z=2
print(-x//z*y)
print(x//z*y)
print(x/y*z)
print(-x/z*y)
print(x*y//z-x//z*y + x/y*z -x/z*y +2.8)

13/09/2020, 5:41 pm - +91 97739 65140: Definitely, true.
13/09/2020, 5:41 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): ++
13/09/2020, 5:41 pm - +91 70218 25025: First is -9
13/09/2020, 5:42 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): How?
13/09/2020, 5:42 pm - +91 97739 65140: 👍🏼 yes
13/09/2020, 5:42 pm - +91 97739 65140: bola it's // operator
13/09/2020, 5:42 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Iska kuch alag hai kya?😂
13/09/2020, 5:43 pm - +91 97739 65140: execute karo and pen paper like calculate karo
13/09/2020, 5:43 pm - +91 97739 65140: *leke
13/09/2020, 5:43 pm - +91 97739 65140: ha, it's floor division not integer division
13/09/2020, 5:43 pm - +91 70218 25025: I dont understand how its broken?? Its intended to do whats its supposed to do. Its the floored division operator
13/09/2020, 5:44 pm - +91 97739 65140: last wala kiya, wo chi kiya to nhi smjhega
13/09/2020, 5:44 pm - +91 97739 65140: there , its giving -6 not -9😅😂
13/09/2020, 5:44 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Haa voh pata hai
13/09/2020, 5:44 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Toh mein sahi tha😂
13/09/2020, 5:45 pm - +91 97739 65140: ha ,so -5//2 = floor(-2.5) = -3
13/09/2020, 5:45 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Ohh mene usko 2 he loya
13/09/2020, 5:45 pm - +91 97739 65140: no, for first is wrong, for last print, it's right
13/09/2020, 5:45 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Got it
13/09/2020, 5:47 pm - +91 97694 89970: True. Danny bhai sahi khel gaye 👌🏼👏🏼

13/09/2020, 5:49 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Haa
13/09/2020, 5:49 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): -3 aya
13/09/2020, 5:50 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Toh it gets -2.5 toh uska floor -3 hoga
13/09/2020, 5:50 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Samjha
13/09/2020, 5:51 pm - +91 97739 65140: yes, unless you make up expressions like this:

13/09/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 70218 25025: Rather than this, id much more like to talk about how python doesnt have argument destructuring, multiple dispatch support and a type system support natively builtin.
13/09/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 97739 65140: go ahead, but first give us resources to study for the same😅
13/09/2020, 6:00 pm - +91 97739 65140: don't take it in a wrong way, I genuinely have no idea what you're talking about. Itna python maine bhi nhi padha to before you start. would like to read more on this😅
13/09/2020, 6:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): -9

13/09/2020, 6:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Lol itna easily toh nahi hoga
13/09/2020, 6:41 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Whats the answer @919773965140 ?
13/09/2020, 6:44 pm - +91 97739 65140: .
13/09/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97739 65140: I guess, if you execute, you will get -0.3 or something
13/09/2020, 6:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > doesnt have argument destructuring

I thought Python does have argument destructuring???
13/09/2020, 6:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917021825025 What do you mean?
13/09/2020, 6:53 pm - +91 70218 25025: It does but not fully yet, like suppose you have an object or a dictionary with around 10 15 entries but in current context you want to work on just few of them so youd have to write something like 
a = d[key].
But in js or something you can take that key value by saying let { a } = d
13/09/2020, 6:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Itn't there a ```**``` operator for things like that?
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): thats for expo
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 🤦‍♂️
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I meant like ```**{...}```
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For dictionaries.
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): okk
13/09/2020, 7:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And also * for lists and tuples.
13/09/2020, 7:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Kwargs?
13/09/2020, 7:40 pm - +91 70218 25025: These spread operators are used to accept variable length arguments, but what im saying is ke when you need only few things, the desturcturing in python gives you everything, you arent able to selectively destructure what you want.
13/09/2020, 7:40 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
13/09/2020, 7:42 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/args-kwargs-python/
13/09/2020, 7:44 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Honestly, I don't think python needs destructuring.
13/09/2020, 7:47 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT) added +91 91673 86883
13/09/2020, 7:44 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can write a method yourself if you reallllly want it.
13/09/2020, 7:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Something like:
```def d(dict, *keys):
    values = []
    for k in keys:
        values.append(dict[k])
    
    return values

dict = {"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2}
a, c = d(dict, "a", "c")```
13/09/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 70218 25025: Yea most of these small things turn into workarounds.
13/09/2020, 7:57 pm - +91 97694 89970: ... reminds me of var-arg method in java lol. And also have seen this in js in spread and rest operators.
13/09/2020, 8:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes in java like this:
public static void main(String ...args)
{
}
13/09/2020, 8:03 pm - +91 97694 89970: 👌🏼👍🏼
13/09/2020, 8:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Wait No it doesn't work with main method lol I tried it
13/09/2020, 8:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): for any other it will
13/09/2020, 8:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): public static void foo(String ...args)
{
}
13/09/2020, 8:04 pm - +91 97694 89970: Arey haa. Got that ..
13/09/2020, 8:08 pm - +91 97694 89970: It works na?!
13/09/2020, 8:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nah
13/09/2020, 8:09 pm - +91 97694 89970: I tried it..
13/09/2020, 8:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): what!/
13/09/2020, 8:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): dcoder pe it doesnt
13/09/2020, 8:09 pm - +91 97739 65140: Can you give a case where * unpacking doesn't work , like for me, even today, adding two dictionaries to create another is 
d= {**d1,**d2} 😅
13/09/2020, 8:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): but Ig I had seen it being used somewhere
13/09/2020, 8:10 pm - +91 97694 89970: It should work actually u knw. Aise idts main method ke liye restriction hai. And execute kiya abhi 😅😂

	{
		System.out.println("Most beautiful main method");
	}
}
13/09/2020, 8:11 pm - +91 97739 65140: d ={    
* * d1, * *d2
}
13/09/2020, 8:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): too much
13/09/2020, 8:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): why add synchronized
13/09/2020, 8:12 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yes 😂
13/09/2020, 8:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): and idk what strictfp is looking it up now
13/09/2020, 8:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): oh its cool
13/09/2020, 8:14 pm - +91 97694 89970: It's just to hype it up. All this adding together in main method works fine. Obvio it's stupidity to use all aise hi. I was just sarcastic that aisa beautiful main method bhi likh sakte hai 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
13/09/2020, 8:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ik
13/09/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 99693 94098: Hey everyone! I would like to share my first Machine Learning article on Medium which is about the application of modern day Deep Learning methods for noise suppression and optimization of the same. Do check it out and let me know what you think about it:

13/09/2020, 10:45 pm - Tushar Nankani: Congratulations @919969394098 on writing your first article on Medium! 👏🏻
It is very well structured, though I didn't understand much! But great work! 🙌🏻💪🏻
13/09/2020, 10:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Whoa💯
13/09/2020, 10:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Using?
13/09/2020, 10:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Using DDA line drawing algorithm and midpoint circle algorithm
13/09/2020, 10:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ooh cool
13/09/2020, 10:46 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): How did you even know the coordinates?
13/09/2020, 10:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The pattern which you see inside is actually imperfections in Low res graphics
it lays out a a beautiful pattern
13/09/2020, 10:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Common sense
Logic
For loops and a paper drawing
13/09/2020, 10:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: Thanks Tushar! I guess I need to work more on the explanation 😂
13/09/2020, 10:51 pm - +91 98337 61116: Ig he meant about the working of deep learning code
13/09/2020, 10:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: I should be able to explain it better for people without an ML to be able to understand. I will keep it in mind next time
13/09/2020, 10:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: ML background*
13/09/2020, 11:25 pm - +91 97739 65140: Bro the article is well written, organized and the explanation is neat. Well done!👍🏻
13/09/2020, 11:29 pm - +91 97739 65140: That's quite a big target you are trying to achieve in just one blog😂
Like you will have to explain from scratch.

I think you mean, someone with basic knowledge should get it. If you want that, try to add some real world relatable examples like when you say two major problems, you can describe why they are problems at the first place
13/09/2020, 11:44 pm - +91 99693 94098: I was avoiding a long article. I wanted to keep it short and with diagrams so that people don't get bored (even more so if they don't understand the subject). I will have to work on shortening them a bit so that I can somehow insert all of this in the middle
13/09/2020, 11:49 pm - +91 98191 73361: 💯💯
14/09/2020, 9:27 am - +91 97739 65140: That makes sense. Not many want to read long articles on ML😅
14/09/2020, 11:57 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Create a 2D array in Java,using a SINGLE for loop:
[1, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
14/09/2020, 11:57 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918451904417  try this, should be pretty easy
14/09/2020, 11:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919969394098 your Medium article is about removing background static from audio clips, right?
14/09/2020, 11:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What is the benefit of using a Neutral Network as opposed to a low pass filter?

14/09/2020, 12:01 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I didnt attempt yet
14/09/2020, 12:01 pm - +91 97027 35002: Tle so....😕
14/09/2020, 12:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): let all try ,I have the solution
14/09/2020, 12:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): this can be done with Java
14/09/2020, 12:07 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Dusri language mein bhi ho sakta hai identity matrix na
14/09/2020, 12:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ha python mai bhibtry idk in that
14/09/2020, 12:08 pm - Tushar Nankani: ```import numpy as np

np.eye(4)```
14/09/2020, 12:09 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Khatam😂
14/09/2020, 12:09 pm - Tushar Nankani: Python :'))
14/09/2020, 12:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Killed it😂
14/09/2020, 12:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nyc

14/09/2020, 12:10 pm - +91 99693 94098: Low pass filter basically works with the logic of a cutoff frequency which might lead to suppression of the foreground voice as well. 
The goal of that network is to make a custom filter which can handle the task better than just a predefined filter which might not be useful in all cases
14/09/2020, 12:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I know that.
14/09/2020, 12:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean is there any measurable difference between using a low pass filter over a Neural Network?
14/09/2020, 12:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Did you compare the results?
14/09/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 99693 94098: I did not compare but I am sure there is. The code is available. Give it a go and let me know
14/09/2020, 12:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The correct way is:
1. Use a "clean" audio clip.
2. Introduce some noise.
3. Remove the noise with different methods.
4. Compare deviation from original waveform.
14/09/2020, 12:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This can be part 2 if you want.
14/09/2020, 12:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Or should I do it myself?
14/09/2020, 12:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Float mai hai

14/09/2020, 12:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): is there a way to get the results in int
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You mean like this?

```int n = 4;

14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): yes
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 99693 94098: The dataset is made using 1 and 2
Regarding 3 you can try it out and check for yourself. The model isn't the best out there. It's fast enough for a user to run on colab which provides replicability which is the purpose of the article.
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Print it in this way
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 99693 94098: I have linked the SEGAN paper if you want. I have linked it in the article as well
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918080142783 definitely knows it
14/09/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 99693 94098: GANs will definitely give better results than autoencoders but you can't guarantee replicability with GANs
14/09/2020, 12:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): See I am asking if all this is actually worth it?
14/09/2020, 12:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Since noise is usually low-amplitude anyways, is there any clear benefit from using an ML model at all.
14/09/2020, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This problem already has an (industy-accepted) solution, so how does your implemetation compare to it?
14/09/2020, 12:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I agree that this is an interesting problem, and any research done here will definately be useful somewhere.
14/09/2020, 12:23 pm - +91 99693 94098: Google is already using it so I guess that speaks for itself
Apart from that, noise is low amplitude is not always true. A car horn isn't of a low amplitude. It might also lead to destructive interference or noise distortion. It's not as easy as using a simple filter to filter out every kind of noise
14/09/2020, 12:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But what I don't like about ML/AI articles is they make it look like a magic silver bullet that can solve all problems.
14/09/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > Google is already using it so I guess that speaks for itself

Hmmm, in what context?
14/09/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'm saying this again, the model in the article is not supposed to be the best. It's supposed to be replicable. The implementation is derived from the SEGAN paper (as mentioned in the article also)
14/09/2020, 12:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > A car horn isn't of a low amplitude.

True, but at that point, you are no longer just removing noise, you are also reconstructing missing audio.
14/09/2020, 12:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I asked it to be the best.
14/09/2020, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What does every single article about BubbleSort or InsertionSort or MergeSort end with?
14/09/2020, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The time complexity.
14/09/2020, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
14/09/2020, 12:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because it is important to understand the tradeoffs of each implementation.
14/09/2020, 12:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *never.
14/09/2020, 12:30 pm - +91 99693 94098: Do you realise that it's not a research paper and ML is purely stochastic? The article is directed towards addressing the two problems mentioned. I realise the tradeoff of each implementation but I don't think it supposed to be in the article. The goal isn't to compare. Its to show how it can be done and how the problems can be addressed
14/09/2020, 12:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > I don't think it supposed to be in the article

I strongly disagree.
14/09/2020, 12:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > Its to show how it can be done and how the problems can be addressed

The article is incomplete if you don't measure the results.
14/09/2020, 12:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919969394098 so are you doing this?
14/09/2020, 12:39 pm - +91 99693 94098: You can try it out and let me know

20/09/2020, 11:11 am - Tushar Nankani: I wouldn't mind such initiatives, that would help maintain the gender ratio!

Just that, it's rather sad the score difference is so vast! 


Microsoft already has women in tech, Google has women techmaker's scholarship and so many more opportunities by other firms. There should be more gender neutral opportunities, based upon _skills._


I think, even if they have such opportunities, to maintain the ratio, at least score difference shouldn't be so much. 

It's a debatable topic, and this is purely my point of view.
20/09/2020, 11:13 am - +91 88284 70904: If they r conducting a coding competition then obviously it should purely be on merit and plus they haven’t specified that it’s for women only or something. So in this case I think it’s completely wrong
20/09/2020, 11:14 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): In my opinion if they want to take only a specific gender then only allow them to compete...why to waste others time and make them feel bad of them selfs
20/09/2020, 11:14 am - +91 88284 70904: Exactly

20/09/2020, 11:35 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): @918080142783 @917506412914 what are your views?
20/09/2020, 11:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 1) You want women empowerment?
--> Conduct women-only hiring drives

2) Don't give false hopes for 1000s of candidates who work hard, score good, expecting they will get a call & then not get selected.


PS: I am neither hardworking nor a woman
Humara dekha jayega
20/09/2020, 11:44 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): True...
20/09/2020, 11:45 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): N please girlscript ka naam change karo😅😂
20/09/2020, 11:46 am - +91 98192 22032: I have a question
Why do you want to maintain gender ratio?
Kya fayada hai?
20/09/2020, 11:46 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Tereko nhi pata par tu hardworking hai😂
20/09/2020, 11:46 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Also,

Just as an add on for big tech companies 😅

20/09/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but if it is women-only opportunity, then they should've  mentioned that.
20/09/2020, 12:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Exactly
20/09/2020, 12:06 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Pls
20/09/2020, 12:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Because the industry should not be male dominated and have equal representation.

(What about the Trans and Queer people though? Do we have opportunities only for them?)
20/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Equal representation won't effect on growth.

20/09/2020, 12:21 pm - +91 98192 22032: If people dont have the appropriate skills and dont deserve the job, giving it to them just to maintain the ratio dont make sense to me
20/09/2020, 12:22 pm - Tushar Nankani: True.
20/09/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 98192 22032: Doesn't*
20/09/2020, 12:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah well they are hired from a pool of female candidates rather than a mixed pool. This def creates an advantage for them to be hired and that is the point of that. Coming to the skills thing, yes there might be differences that will have to patched up later on...
20/09/2020, 12:26 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Well this is just what I think. Feel free to educate me if you think I'm wrong. 👍

20/09/2020, 2:04 pm - +91 98337 26449: It's the same as hiring different races. Everyone has different views. If you just look at it from one perspective your definitely won't find the best solution.
20/09/2020, 2:08 pm - +91 98337 26449: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/rwanda-genocide-women-job-africa-tutsi-gender-politics-feminism-survivors-a8425846.html
20/09/2020, 2:08 pm - +91 98337 26449: The country recovered from genocide mainly because women had the opportunity to take up government roles. And now they have low af corruption. Can you say the same about our country which is lead by men?
20/09/2020, 2:09 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Kafi feminist para😂
20/09/2020, 2:10 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): My view is...it depends upon the people of that nation and how leaders think
20/09/2020, 2:10 pm - +91 98337 26449: I'm not a feminist. But saying that women shouldn't be given the opportunities they deserve is wrong. I have a mother and a sister. So maybe I was raised right?
20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah, this topic is a bit controversial
20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Opportunities should be given to who are working hard, not because of thier gender. No one had an option to be a male or a female but they have option to work on themselves and be better tomorrow.
20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - +91 96190 16721: True👍
20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): A lot.
20/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Very true
20/09/2020, 2:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Emphasis **deserve** part.
20/09/2020, 2:17 pm - +91 98337 26449: Every heard of quotas for underrepresentation? Minority quota? SINDHI QUOTA? Maybe tsec has one? Theres ebc obc all that. It's literally for a fair ground for everyone
20/09/2020, 2:19 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): This might be the requirement at the time when the laws were written but today this is all political and I don't they are required now.
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Think*
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's where you're wrong. Because you can't just undo hundreds of years of underrepresentation.
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 98337 26449: In a couple of years
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: If you think that. Please don't become a manager/politician
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): There will be riots
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 47258: So who says what's been happening is right
Just bcs something happened doesn't mean it's correct, 
People adopted slavery for ages but that doesn't justify it
They were given low opportunities back in the day
If you wanna give quotas, give on the basis on basis on wealth then
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: Ebc is that
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: Economically backward
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): We all want reservation only on basis of wealth
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 47258: Why can't you
They were oppressed at a point. They aren't now
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: 😂😂😂 so all has been undone? Magic? Tada
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It hurt a lot to see soo many seats go in reserved category
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Not in a click
But gradually yeah
There's been a huge change
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: Just because you aren't getting it it hurts naa? If you did get it you would be happy af
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Talking about obc
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: Think about it from the others perspective for once. Don't be so self absorbed
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Now  its purely on basis of votes
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Ik people so damn wealthy getting low grades and qualifying for IIT
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: Barely. Any change
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Yes
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: Basically the moral of the story is. You guys are salty because you guys aren't getting it right?
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: No other reason
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean they need votes ,one who tries to touch the reservation policy gets burned
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: The truth is
Ones who weren't oppressed ones are the ones getting oppressed , getting low chances just bcs of the term "reserved"
There are equal opportunities for all now
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: If it was in your favou
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: You would be happy
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: *favour
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: No one goes for a job interview and says you are obc? You can't get it
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: It used to be there back in the day
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: So there's more women than men in Google now? Doubt x
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: No 
We are salty bcs the undeserving ones get it
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Reservation was meant to be continued only for 10-15 years after independence
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ++
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): ++
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Exactly. So if you grandparents didn't get a job. That means they were labours. So automatically your father had lower opportunities
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Get it?
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: It's generations
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Not just
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 47258: Nope
More men bcs more men qualified and looked for jobs there
Not bcs they are men
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: One generation
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: You think you deserve to be at Google?
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: All of you?
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: So go with wealth
If my grandfather was obc 
But I'm rich now
I don't think I should be given an edge
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: No
Never said that
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): We deserve to have equal opportunities
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: Because it's been going on for generations. Some didn't even let their daughters study.
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Arre jobs ki kon baat kar raha hai we are now talking about quotas
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: But give to the ones who deserves
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: So when have you guys been oppressed?
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: Sir
Things are changing
If you wanna encourage then encourage their studies
Not give away jobs
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ++
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): That was because of mindset of thier parents no one stopped them
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: Taking away seats
What if I deserved a place
But half were reserved
I lost my place
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: It's 2020
Not 1920
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 26449: What if they pass a law tomorrow. Men aren't allowed to drive a car, vote or even go out as unmarried?
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): By running for better college even after getting better marks than my friend who got into IIT because of his certificate
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's real oppression
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 47258: If you discriminate even slightly now you don't go away free
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Pain
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 47258: Are women not allowed now?
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 47258: Again
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 47258: It's 2020
20/09/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Maybe women wala quota should continue for some more years now but reservation 🙏

20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 26449: Need to think
20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 26449: About others
20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 26449: A little more
20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 26449: Have a little humanity?
20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 47258: And you know why there are less women in technical fields?
Bcs *statistically* women tend to go towards more creative jobs, less technical
Stats
20/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 98337 47258: We have humanity
We think about all IRRESPECTIVE of gender
20/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 98337 47258: If a women *deserves* to rule the world
She should
20/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 98337 47258: Okay lemme tell you some facts
20/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 98337 47258: In IITs
20/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 98337 47258: Most of the suicides happening
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 47258: Most of them come from reserved categories
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: You know when Amazon trained an ai to select resumes?
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 47258: They come in but can't cope up
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Did you all heard about that
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: *hear
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: The ai only selected men
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Because it was trained on that
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Because
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: A majority of the men selected before
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Were men
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I think the argument is that if a man *deserves* to rule the world then he should not be denied because he is a man.
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 96374 40537: Exactly
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's the whole point of underrepresentation
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 47258: Sir
Look at the above message
Why it's more men in technical fields
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 47258: Bcs statistically it's men preferring such jobs
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 26449: Then give her a chance naa that's the point
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Agreed.
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 47258: Not bcs they are given more
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Agreed.
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Opportunities are not given it needs to be created
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 47258: Chance milte hai
Barabar milte hai
Koi resume dekhkar bolta Nahi ki ladki hai toh nope
It's the other way round now
They are selections JUST for women
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: And about giving chance
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: Trump and Hillary
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: Both were given equal chances
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: People opted for Trump
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: Both suck
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: I know
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: But it wasn't the gender
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: If you look at the events taken place then, it was her careless acts
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: New Zealand
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 99203 34360: How many female leaders have there been in history compared to male?
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But after giving a chance if she is not as good as a man (for whatever reason) then select the man.
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: Woman leads there
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: Why
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 26449: So trump is all good? He's perfect?
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: Bcs she deserves
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: .
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: ^
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 26449: And who decided that? A majority of men? Makes sense
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): How many stood for elections??
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 🤦‍♂️
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - +91 99203 34360: Why didn't they stand for elections?
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - +91 98337 47258: Who chose those men?
Secret ballot?
Yes
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - +91 99203 34360: Because men didn't let them
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Mene roka nhi unko
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - +91 99203 34360: Because society doesn't let them
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - +91 98337 26449: Exactly
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): There was an OBJECTIVE MEASURE.
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Aka test scores.
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: Because the society that we live in now periodically favours men
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: And always has
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: In every way possible
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: That's why we have these structures in place
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 96190 16721: It's not about chances, lets say government gives a woman land to do agriculture still the people will oppress her and tease her for doing that and not looking after the house chores
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: To uplift women
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: That's what they have feeded in your minds
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: To make role models
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: Let me tell you about the voting rights
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: So other women can look up to them
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: Women weren't allowed to vote right?
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 26449: It's literally that way for women and African Americans. They've been oppressed for so long. That 10 years of Support isn't gonna go shit
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: At least for US I know
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: EXACTLYYY 😂😂😂😂
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, I am not 100% happy with hireing based on scores, but if that is the criteria, then the least you can do is follow it objectively.
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Mamta Banerjee.
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: They weren't

20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: They weren't bcs THEY DIDN'T want to

20/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 98337 26449: So now you know what women want? You must be great in bed
20/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 99203 34360: Imagine how much discrimination
20/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 99203 34360: Exists
20/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 98337 47258: According to laws
They had to do specific hours of labour
20/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 98337 47258: Lemme speak

20/09/2020, 2:39 pm - +91 99203 34360: That's a first
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 98337 26449: Yes. Gender discrimination is solved
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 98337 47258: According to stats 60% didn't want to
It was the men leading then encouraged
Women didn't want to work doing labour
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 98337 26449: Thank you sparsh

20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 98337 47258: That's at least for US
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 98337 47258: And that did happen
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 99203 34360: I think you don't know
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 98337 47258: Check history

20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): To be fair, ask your parents if they would like to vote.
They will say it is too much of a hassle 😂
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 99203 34360: Before you embarrass yourself more
20/09/2020, 2:40 pm - +91 99203 34360: I think you should research thoda
20/09/2020, 2:41 pm - +91 98337 47258: If talking about voting in specific then you should check the facts
20/09/2020, 2:41 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard
20/09/2020, 2:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Really?
20/09/2020, 2:41 pm - +91 98337 47258: I did
You are talking form emotions and not facts

But you mention even in the places they weren't

20/09/2020, 2:42 pm - +91 98337 47258: But in today's world things are different
20/09/2020, 2:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK.
20/09/2020, 2:42 pm - +91 98337 47258: No one sees your gender and let's you
20/09/2020, 2:42 pm - +91 98337 47258: Infact

Link - http://www.tseccodecell.com/challenges
20/09/2020, 3:52 pm - Tushar Nankani: I read all of them.
20/09/2020, 3:52 pm - Tushar Nankani: When I sent the message in the morning, the group was open for discussions. I wanted to know everyone's  _opinion_. We wanted to know what everyone thinks about it. 

I didn't want the discussions to be directed at one another or this discussion to scale up into a messy debate. I don't know how it got all scaled up 😂

Yes, there are a lot of factors overlapping in situations like gender inequality and the caste system. 

We all got to know about everyone's perspective to look at it. It's simply not black and white. I got to know a lot from this discussion. 

Thank you!

Google has recently launched a new facilitator program called Google Cloud Crash Course. Google Cloud Crash Course program will provide engineering students an opportunity to kickstart their learning on cloud technology using practice on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Each campus can nominate one person to be a facilitator and lead this initiative in their college. Upon nomination and selection, these facilitators will receive some training on how to lead these sessions and motivate more students to participate.

If anyone here has some familiarity with cloud and is interested to become a facilitator, dm me.

21/09/2020, 11:06 am - +91 82916 21138: What I read online was ki paytym was given 3 notice but did not change , actually paytym got banned due to his betting games which Google strongly condemns
21/09/2020, 11:07 am - +91 82916 21138: Also it was done to show that Google doesn't care if your company is big or small if you break rules it will taken down

21/09/2020, 11:09 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If someone was using Paytm then they can confirm that if you were able to buy scratch cards and stuff or it was only by recharges and payments
21/09/2020, 11:10 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah but it wasn't gambling right?
21/09/2020, 11:15 am - +91 82916 21138: Idk I heard paytym games had some gambling game and paytym had some add or feature to redirect to that game so Google again doesn't allow it .
21/09/2020, 11:42 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F
21/09/2020, 11:44 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): If you can buy scratch cards then it is gambling
21/09/2020, 11:45 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes maybe
21/09/2020, 11:45 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): And tbh this gambling stuff is very complex
21/09/2020, 11:49 am - Darshan Rander (TSEC, IT): Many games have treasure boxes which user can buy and this is almost same as gambling but what they say is it is not gambling because you aren't getting back any real world entity just some game props🤦‍♂️
21/09/2020, 11:49 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): lmao yes

23/09/2020, 1:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): wait
23/09/2020, 1:49 pm - +91 82916 21138: We define super digit of an integer  using the following rules:
	
	


Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer using recursion.


	
If x has only digit, then its super digit is x.
	Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.


For example, the super digit of 9875 will be calculated as:

            super_digit(9875)        9+8+7+5 = 29 

            super_digit(29)            2 + 9 = 11

            super_digit(11)            1 + 1 = 2

            super_digit(2)              = 2

Subjects like dlda and DSA are easily manageable if you have a brief idea of what's happening in the pracs.

Discrete structures can be done at the end through YouTube

25/09/2020, 1:59 pm - +91 97027 35002: Depends what the kid likes
25/09/2020, 1:59 pm - +91 97027 35002: Some dont prefer sports...
25/09/2020, 1:59 pm - +91 97027 35002: You get the point
25/09/2020, 2:00 pm - +91 98191 73361: True, but the way they are selling it, it looks like if your kid doesn't study coding early on, he will be nothing later in life
25/09/2020, 2:00 pm - +91 98337 47258: It's actually gonna support the new education policies, maybe 7 is too young
Plus kids these days are playing games on phones and tablets all day 
If it's about spending time on screens then either allow both or don't
25/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 97027 35002: ✅✅
25/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 88284 70904: Coding is important I agree 
But learning basic things in life are important too, it shouldn’t be enforced on students
25/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 98191 73361: Fair enough
25/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 88284 70904: Fair point bro
25/09/2020, 2:11 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): @918080142783 was coding before he was born bro 7 is too old for him
25/09/2020, 2:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 😂

25/09/2020, 2:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I remember hating computers when I was in 3rd - 4th.
25/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): hmm
25/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why? because the Lab was too cold 😂
25/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): so when did you begin liking it
25/09/2020, 2:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): all education policies will go waste if marks score karne wala battle keeps on existing
25/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I hated comps until I took it as a subject in 9th grade but I never explored by myself :(

25/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): you were in ICSE right!?
25/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But then we had a lot of theory, which was OK.
25/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): what was your 3rd group subject?
25/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
I had taken Drama as my 3rd subject.
25/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I remember this lmao I hated iy
25/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not totally boring, but not very interesting.
25/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): QBasic was nice.

27/09/2020, 2:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hey there,

The other day I read this story of a fledgling Python coder named Seth on Reddit:

Seth's been learning Python for 5 months, and things have been "hit and miss" for a while now.

A few weeks ago he completed a free coding course. But since then his progress came to a grinding halt.

Seth's doing fine at the small exercises—write a function here, reverse this list there—but when it comes to writing more substantial programs on his own, he just can't get them to work.

When Seth embarked on his "coding journey" a fire burned in his belly, but now he doesn't really feel enthusiastic about anything.

It's not like his motivation is dead and gone—

Every time he looks at the neat stuff he could use his programming skills for, he knows deep down that he WANTS to learn.

But the fire he once felt for Python and coding in general has faded into a dim glow at this point.

Seth started out learning Python with a friend, but his friend surpassed him within three weeks. 

Seth still feels like a "noob," and when his friend texted him a link to one of his little web app side-projects, Seth ignored the message for days.

How come Seth's progress has been sitting at a standstill? How did he end up in this trap, feeling his stomach churn every time he thinks about writing another line of code?

Seth says he simply has no idea *what* to program in order to get better. He has no project, nor an idea he wants to get started with. 

And he doesn't feel comfortable coding the programs he thinks he *should* be able to code by now. There's no going back or going forward.

I call this "Python Paralysis"...

When you're tired of slogging through another coding tutorial, putting in more effort than most people, but STILL not seeing results... you know why most people don't become professional programmers!

The real problem isn't the effort itself, it's all the other stuff that sabotages the effort.

If you're wondering, I speak from experience here.

Seth's story is pretty much exactly how I felt in the beginning of any big challenge I ever tackled in my life, whether that's learning how to program, getting my first coder job, or becoming self-employed and starting a business.

If you're in the same spot right now, here's what you need to realize:

If you get through this and keep pressing forward, you're going to get to a stage that's a whole lot better. Push through this, and your efforts will start paying off and people will start respecting you.

It takes guts and determination to make it past the "paralysis" and confusion. You need to have conviction, and a tolerance for pain. 

Let me ask you this: How do you KNOW you have a dream? Like, REALLY know it?

When it hurts so bad that you can taste it. When you feel your heart lurch in your chest every time you think about the unfulfilled possibilities.

That's when you need to keep pushing forward, that's when you're oh so close to getting your reward, but you don't see it yet.

Don't throw in the towel. Keep pushing forward. 

And take another step towards your goal.

Do watch!!!
01/10/2020, 3:29 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Those who have received the credits, they can view the program syllabus here-
https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/program-syllabus/#content
and start with their labs
Note-You will get the goodies only if you complete the tracks mentioned on the website

If you haven't received the credits, follow the steps in the image sent below
If you don't get the credits even after following those steps, you can use the "Chat" section on qwiklabs and tell them that you've followed the procedure and still didn't receive credits. 
Mostly, they'll solve your problem, else they'll ask you to wait for the mail
As for the mail, I've asked the officials about the delay in receiving mails, they said they are sending out mail in batches, so you should receive yours latest by 2nd Oct night
